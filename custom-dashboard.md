## Removing widgets
{: #remove-widget}

## Reorganizing your dashboard
{: #reorg-dashboard}

You can rearrange the order of the widgets on your dashboard by grabbing a widget and moving it. For example, as an account owner, tracking who has access to your account might be a top priority for you. You want these details to be displayed at the top of your dashboard, but you have to scroll to find the User access widget. Grab the widget to move it to the top of your dashboard.

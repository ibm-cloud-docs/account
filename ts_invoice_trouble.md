# Why can't I view the invoices for my Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account in the console?
{: #ts_cant-view-invoice}
{: troubleshoot}

You're unable to view your invoices in the console because they're managed on a separate billing platform.
{: shortdesc}

Invoices that are managed outside of the console cannot be viewed by going to **Manage** > **Billing and Usage** > **Invoices** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
{: important}

As a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account owner, you might not be able to view your invoices from the Invoices page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.
{: tsSymptoms}

When you try to view your invoices, either of the following messages is displayed:

```text
Your invoices are managed through IBM.com.
This account is invoiced on a separate billing platform.
```

If you have a Pay-As-You-Go account that is billed in a currency other than US dollars or a Subscription account, you view your invoices on the [IBM Invoices](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/invoices/welcome){: external} website, which is linked from the Invoices page in the console.
{: tsCauses}

If you're visiting the Invoices website for the first time, sign up with your IBMid and complete your profile. Then, add access to your account with your IBM customer number.
{: tsResolve}

1. Go to [IBM Invoices](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/invoices/welcome){: external}, and select your region.
1. Log in with the same IBMid and password that you use to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
1. Complete your profile on the Invoices website.
1. From the Invoices website, go to the Accesses tab. Add access to your account and provide your IBM customer number. If you don't know your customer number, contact IBM Cloud Support by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option or contact the [eCustomer Care team](https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/homepage/ecarec){: external} for help.

To access your invoices in the future, you can click the link from the Invoices page in the console or bookmark the external invoices website to go to it directly. If you are able to view your invoices and think information is incorrect or missing, go to [IBM Customer Support](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/){: external} to open a case to request for assistance with the IBM Invoices team.

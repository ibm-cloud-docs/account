# Using the notification distribution list
{: #add-users-distribution-list}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [Notification distribution list page](/account/notifications-distribution-list){: external} provides a way for you to specify a set of email addresses or webhooks to set suitable destinations for notifications about account-wide events.
{: shortdesc}

You can manage the notification distribution list by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. You can create a list of up to 10 email addresses can receive notifications. Emails that are added to the distribution list are notified about any event that is affecting the account. You must have the editor role or higher on the account management service to add email addresses to the distribution list. For more information, see [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services).

Email addresses that are added to the distribution list by the account owner receive notifications about any incident, maintenance, announcement, or security bulletin that appears on the account owner's [Notifications page](/notifications){: external}.

In addition to adding email addresses, you can also add up to 10 webhooks to a distribution list. Account administrators can create and use webhooks to configure an application to receive asynchronous notifications whenever a platform event occurs. The registered webhooks send the information to the specified URL in the form of an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload. The content-type of the request is `application/json`.

## Adding email addresses to a notification distribution list in the console
{: #add-users-console}

To add emails to a notification distribution list, complete the following steps:

1. Using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Account** > **Notification distribution list**.
2. Select **Add** > **Email**.
3. Enter a name and an email address.

    You can add up to 10 email addresses to the distribution list. Email addresses don't need to correspond to known users in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can add any type.
    {: note}

4. Click **Add**.

### Unsubscribing from the distribution list
{: #unsubscribe-distribution-list}

To unsubscribe from the distribution list, use the link in the footer of any email that is sent from the distribution list.

## Enabling {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} for the notification distribution list
{: #event-notifications-distribution-list}

With {{site.data.keyword.en_full}}, you can choose to deliver your notifications to different destinations, including email, SMS, or webhooks. {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} is an alternative to the notification distribution list. It provides a way for you to be notified about critical events that occur in your account, and manage your notifications at scale. For more information, see [Getting started with Event Notifications](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started).

When an event of interest occurs on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and an event is generated, the notification distribution list communicates with a connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to forward a notification to the supported destination. For more information about supported {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} destinations, see [Event destinations](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-push).

### Events for notifications
{: #events-for-notifications}

### Adding an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to the notification distribution list
{: #event-notifications-add-ui}

Before you can add any {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to the notification distribution list, make sure that you already have an [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance](/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external} that is in the same account as the distribution list.
If you don't have an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance, see [Getting started with Event Notifications](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started).
To add an existing {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance to the notification distribution list, complete the following steps:

1. Using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Account** > **Notification distribution list**.
1. Click **Add** > **{{site.data.keyword.en_short}}**.
1. Select an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance from the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance list. If you don't have an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that you can connect to your account, you can create one in the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog](/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external}.
1. Click **Add**.

You cannot add an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance to the notification distribution list that is already configured.
{: note}

### Sending test notifications to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance
{: #send-test-notifications-en}

After you added an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to your notification distribution list, you can test it out to make sure that the events that are generated by the Notifications service are being forwarded to that instance.

Complete the following steps to send a test notification to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Account > Notification distribution list**.
1. Select the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance that you want to send a test notification to, and click the **Actions** icon ![Actions](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Test**.
1. Select the notification event type that you want to test, and then click **Send test**.
    1. To resend the test notification, click **Resend test**.

### Notification payload details
{: #notification-payload}

When an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance is added to your accountâ€™s distribution list and the account receives a notification, a notification payload is sent to that {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance. The payload object properties are the same for all event types. See the following payload example that contains detailed information about a maintenance event for sending a test notification:

| `data`              | A notification object that contains the metadata about the notification event. Every event type has the same data properties. This consists of the `sourceID`, `category`, `severity`, `crnMasks`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `title`, and `body`.  \n  \n `sourceID`: a special identifier that contains the prefix of the system that is used to create the notification, as well as a unique value. It is not related to the `source` property found in the payload.  \n `category`: The type of notification sent (same as the event name).  \n `severity`: Number to represent the severity level. For a maintenance event type, the values are one of `[1,2,3]`. For an incident event type, the values are one of `[1,2,3,4]`. For other event types, the value is `""`.  \n `crnMasks`: An array of CRNs that represent a list of affected service types and regions (not specific instances).  \n `startTime`: The start time of the event in Unix time. Only announcements, security bulletins, and billing and usage event types have a value of `""`.  \n `endTime`: The end time of the event in Unix time.

### Headers
{: #header-payload}

You receive the payload with a header that you configured in the UI when you added a webhook, and with an additional version header that has a semantic version number. This version header can be used to determine the expected format of the webhook payload.

The current version header is `"IBM-Notifications-API-Version": "v2.0.0"`.

### Field values
{: #field-value-payload}

The following descriptions provide information about the field values that are being sent inside the payload:

`body`: This field describes the event that is happening on the platform and concerns you. This field contains a detailed, human readable description of the notification and can be several paragraphs long. It can also contain html formatting. This field is configured to support more languages, although only English is supported currently.

`category`: The type of the event. This can be incident, maintenance, announcement, or security bulletins.

`componentNames`: If a service is impacted, this field represents it. This can also be a global value like `Component: IBM Cloud`, not only a specific service. See the services on the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog page](/catalog#services){: external}.

`regions`: This field shows you the location of the event.

`severity`: This field refers to the severity of the event. This can be Severity 1, 2, 3 or 4 for incidents, high, medium, or low for maintenance, and major or minor for announcements. See the following detailed severity level descriptions:

    * **Incidents**
      * `Severity 1`: Business-critical functionality is inoperable or critical interference failed. This severity usually applies to the production environment and the inability to access services is causing a critical impact on operations.
      * `Severity 2`: Core functionality is impacted. Service is operational but causing major impact on usage.
      * `Severity 3`: Partial or noncritical disruption to functionality with minimal or isolated impact.
      * `Severity 4`: A minor issue that requires action, but does not impact functionality or usage.
    * **Maintenance**
      * `High impact`: Maintenance will, or is likely to cause service outages and disruptions.
      * `Medium impact`: Maintenance will, or is likely to cause measurable service degradation but not an actual outage.
      * `Low impact`: Maintenance will cause no service disruption during or after the maintenance window.
    * **Announcements**
      * `Major`: Important incidents such as legal notices, service deprecation, or security patches.
      * `Minor`: Informative announcements such as product enhancements.

The severity attribute in the request payload can take on a value of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The following table lists the severity values and their corresponding classifications:

| Severity value | Incident   | Maintenance | Announcement |
|----------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| 0              | Severity 4 | Low         | Minor        |
| 1              | Severity 1 | High        | Major        |
| 2              | Severity 2 | Medium      | Minor        |
| 3              | Severity 3 | Low         | Minor        |
| 4              | Severity 4 | Low         | Minor        |
{: caption="Severity levels and their corresponing categories" caption-side="top"}

`state`: This field is only for maintenance and notifications. See the following possible values:

    * Values for *Maintenance* states: Planned, In progress, Completed, Canceled, Failed
    * Values for *Incident* states: New issue, Investigating, Resolved

`title`: The title field tells you what the notification is about. This field is configured to support more languages, although only English is supported currently.

`startTime`, `endTime`: You can check when the event starts, and when it ends.

The `startTime` and `endTime` fields show the start time and end time of the event in Unix Coordinated Universal Time timestamps.
{: note}

Fields that are sent inside the payload can be either required or optional. Optional fields, for example `startTime`, are passed if the notification has this type of information, and aren't be passed if the notification does not have it. Required fields, for example `category`, are passed in all cases. The following table lists which fields are required and which ones are optional:

| Field | Required or optional |
|--|--|
|**account_id**: account_id|Required|
|**category**: notification.category |Required|
|**title**: notification.title |Required|
|**startTime**: notification.startTime |Optional|
|**endTime**: notification.endTime |Optional|
|**updateTime**: notification.updateTime |Optional|
|**body**: notification.body|Required|
|**state**: notification.state|Optional|
|**sourceID**: notification.sourceID |Optional|
|**regions**: notification.regions|Optional|
|**continentNames**: notification.continentNames|Optional|
|**regionNames**: notification.regionNames|Optional|
|**componentNames**: notification.componentNames |Optional|
|**subCategory**: notification.subCategory|Optional|
|**severity**: notification.severity|Optional|
{: caption="Fields in a payload" caption-side="top"}

Additional fields might be added in the future without a major version change. This means that any code that is processing notifications should be prepared to ignore the fields that it does not recognize.
{: note}

To create a webhook in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, first create the incoming webhook in Microsoft Teams. This allows external apps to share content in Teams channels, and provides the unique URL where you can send the notification message text in the form of a JSON payload. You receive the notifications in the selected Teams channel in which you added the incoming webhook. For more information, see [Create Incoming Webhook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet){: external}.

To add a Microsoft Teams webhook in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Account** > **Notification distribution list** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
1. Click **Add**, and select **Microsoft Teams**.
1. Enter a name for your webhook and a Microsoft Teams webhook URL. The notifications are sent to this unique URL.

## Setting up ServiceNow webhooks
{: #set-snow-webhook}

Unlike Microsoft Teams and Slack webhook integrations, setting up a ServiceNow webhook requires configuration to be done on the webhook destination side.

First, you need to create a Scripted REST API on the ServiceNow website. After the Scripted REST API is configured, you also need to create a Scripted REST API Resource. The request method needs to be set to HTTP POST. Then, you need to provide a code for the resource to run.

When you are ready with the process and have the URL for your Scripted REST API, you can start to use it on the **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Notification distribution list** page and create webhooks.

To get to know the complete ServiceNow webhook integration process, follow the instructions in the [How to Integrate Webhooks Into ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/community/in-other-news/how-to-integrate-webhooks-into-servicenow/ba-p/2271745){: external} blog post. This blog walks you through the steps in detail.

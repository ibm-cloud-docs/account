# Restricting domains for account invitations
{: #restrict-acct-invite}

You can restrict membership to your account based on the domain of the users that are added to your allowlist. This way, only users with a specific domain or domains can be invited to the account. To update this setting, you must be assigned the `editor` role or higher on the IAM Identity Service.

Domain restrictions are implemented by setting email patterns. For example, `**@ibm.com`, `**@*.ibm.com`, `**@?.ibm.com`. A single asterisk `*` represents any sequence of zero or more characters in a string, except the sequence ends if a period `.` or at sign `@` is found. A double asterisk `**` represents any sequence of zero or more characters in the string without limit. A question mark `?` represents any single character.

Let's take a closer look at the example `**@*.ibm.com`. The username part of the email address specifies `**`. Since the sequence is not limited by `.`, an email address like `my.name.is.bob@us.ibm.com` is valid. The subdomain `us` is also valid because it is a string of letters, where the sequence ends with `.`.

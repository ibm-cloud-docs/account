# Suspending a version of a private product
{: #suspend-product}

If you need to remove a version of your software that's published to your account without permanently deleting or deprecating it, you can suspend it for 7 days. Suspending a product can be useful if, for example, you discover a bug or a vulnerability in your product that must be investigated before more users install it.
{: shortdesc}

Suspending a version of your product will not permanently delete it from your account. If you need to permanently delete a version of your product, deprecate it instead.
{: note}

Complete the following steps to suspend your version:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Private catalogs**.
1. Select the private catalog where your product is located.
1. Select your product.
1. Select the version that you want to suspend.

   If your software has only one shared version, and you suspend that version, the entire product is suspended.
   {: note}

1. Open the **Actions** menu and select **Suspend**.
1. Click **Suspend**.

You can also suspend a version by clicking the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg "Actions") for that version and selecting **Suspend**.

After you suspend a version of your product, you must share it again within 7 days, or your version will be deprecated. Deprecated versions are removed after 90 days. For more information, see [Sharing private catalog products](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-share&interface=ui).

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} can suspend your product if there's an issue that you need to address. Any updates that you need to make are shared by email.

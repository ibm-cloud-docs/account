# Leaving an account
{: #account-membership}

As a user on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you can be a member of multiple accounts. If your projects and priorities change or you are added to an account by mistake, you can leave the account.
{: shortdesc}

When you leave an account, all of your account-related data like IAM policies and API keys are deleted. This action can’t be undone, and an account owner must add you back if you want to join the account again.

To leave an account, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, switch to the account that you want to leave from the console menu bar.
1. Go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Users** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, .
1. Find your name in the users list. 
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) > **Remove user**. 
1. Click **Remove**.

You can also remove yourself from an account on the [Verification methods and authentication factors](https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/mysecurity){: external} page by clicking **Show accounts**, selecting the account, and clicking **Leave**. Confirm that you want to leave the account and click **Yes**.

# Leaving an account
{: #account-membership}

As a user on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you can be a member of multiple accounts. If your projects and priorities change or you are added to an account by mistake, you can leave the account. 
{: shortdesc}

When you leave an account, all of your account-related data like IAM policies and API keys are deleted. This action canâ€™t be undone, and an account owner must add you back if you want to join the account again.

To leave an account, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, switch to the account that you want to leave from the console menu bar.
1. Go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Users** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, .
1. Find your name in the users list. 
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) > **Remove user**. 
1. Click **Remove**.

You can also remove yourself from an account on the [Verification methods and authentication factors](https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/mysecurity){: external} page by clicking **Show accounts**, selecting the account, and clicking **Leave**. Confirm that you want to leave the account and click **Yes**.

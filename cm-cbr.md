# Protecting catalogs with context-based restrictions
{: #cbr}

Context-based restrictions give account owners and administrators the ability to define and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resources based on the context of access requests. Access to catalogs (Catalog Management service) can be controlled with context-based restrictions and identity and access management (IAM) policies.
{: shortdesc}

These restrictions work with traditional IAM policies, which are based on identity, to provide another layer of protection. Unlike IAM policies, context-based restrictions don't assign access. Context-based restrictions check that an access request comes from an allowed context that you configure. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials. For more information, see [What are context-based restrictions](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis).


Any {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong_notm}} or audit log events generated come from the context-based restrictions service, not Catalog Management. For more information, see [Monitoring context-based restrictions](/docs/account?topic=account-cbr-monitor).

## Before you begin
{: #before-cm-cbr}

Review the following access requirements:
- A user must have the Administrator role on the Catalog Management service to create, update, or delete rules.
- A user must also have either the Editor or Administrator role on the Context-based restrictions service to create, update, or delete network zones.
- A user with the Viewer role on the Context-based restrictions service can add only network zones to a rule.

To get started protecting your catalogs with context-based restrictions, see the tutorial for [Leveraging context-based restrictions to secure your resources](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-tutorial).

## How catalogs integrate with context-based restrictions
{: #cbr-overview-cm}

### Protecting specific APIs
{: #cm-cbr-apis}

You can create context-based restrictions to protect the following APIs for the Catalog Management Service.

Service APIs
:   Target Service APIs to protect actions like sharing private catalogs and managing catalog settings.

Platform APIs
:   Target Platform APIs to protect create, update, and delete actions on your private catalogs. When a context-based restriction is protecting the Catalog Management Platform APIs, users must satisfy the rule to view the private catalogs that you specify.

### Protecting specific resources
{: #cm-cbr-attributes}

You can protect specific resources by scoping your rule to the available attributes for Catalog Management.

Catalog
:   Scope your rule to protect a specific private catalog. Users can view the catalog that you protect only if they satisfy your context rule.

## Limitations
{: #cbr-limitations-cm}

Context-based restrictions protect only the actions associated with the [Catalog Management API](/apidocs/resource-catalog/private-catalog). For more information, see [IAM roles and actions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions&interface=ui#globalcatalog-collection-roles). Actions that are associated with the following platform APIs are not protected by context-based restrictions. Reference the API docs for the specific action IDs.

- [Resource Instance APIs](/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#list-resource-instances)
- [Resource Keys APIs](/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#list-resource-keys)
- [Resource Bindings APIs](/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#list-resource-bindings)
- [Resource Aliases APIs](/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#list-resource-aliases)
- [IAM Policy APIs](/apidocs/iam-policy-management#list-policies)
- [Global Search APIs](/apidocs/search)
- Global Tagging [Attach](/apidocs/tagging#attach-tag) and [Detach](/apidocs/tagging#detach-tag) APIs
- [Context-based Restriction Rule APIs](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#create-rule)
- [Secrets Manager APIs](/apidocs/secrets-manager)


## Creating network zones
{: #network-zone-cm}

A network zone represents an allowlist of IP addresses where an access request is created. It defines a set of one or more network locations that are specified by the following attributes:

* IP addresses, which include individual addresses, ranges, or subnets.
* VPCs
* Service references, which allow access from other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.

Make sure to add Catalog Management to network zones for rules that target other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, or some operations in your workflow might fail.
{: important}

### Service references
{: #service-ref-cm}

Add the Catalog Management Service (`globalcatalog-collection`) to your network zones for rules created against the following services. This way, the two services can continue to communicate.

Secrets Manager
:   If you have a rule that protects Secrets Manager and you’re [onboarding a product with Secrets Manager](/docs/account?topic=account-create-private-catalog&interface=ui#add-public-repo-ui), add your IP address and the Catalog Management service to a network zone as a service reference.

Schematics
:   If you’re using a [target account](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-service-authorization&interface=ui) to validate a product and you have a rule protecting Schematics in the target account, add the Catalog Management service to a network zone as a service reference.

Similarly, if you have a rule that targets the Catalog Management Service, add the Schematics service as a service reference in the network zone.
{: important}

IAM Identity
:   If you have a rule scoped to protect the entire IAM Identity service or scoped to the [trusted profile that you use for validation](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-cross-validation&interface=ui#target-trusted-profile), add the Catalog Management service to a network zone as a service reference so that the validation flow still works.

Make sure to add that network zone to your context-based restriction rule. This way, the two services can continue to communicate.
{: tip}

### Example by using the console
{: #service-ref-cm-ex}
{: ui}

By creating network zones, you establish a list of allowed locations where an access request originates. Add the Catalog Management service to that allowlist as a service reference. After you create a network zone, you can add it to a rule.

To create a network zone, complete the following steps:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Context-based restrictions**, and select **Network zones**.
1. Click **Create**.

    Instead of creating a zone by using UI inputs, you can use the JSON code form to directly enter JSON to create a zone by clicking **Enter as JSON code**.
    {: note}

1. Enter a unique name and a description. For example, "Catalog zone" and "Allow catalogs to interact with other services".
1. Reference a service. Select the service type "IAM services" and then select the Catalog Management service. Click **Add** to associate the service's IP addresses with your network zone.
1. Click **Next** to review your network zone.
1. Click **Create**.


### Example by using the CLI
{: #service-ref-cm-ex-cli}
{: cli}

By creating network zones, you establish a list of allowed locations where an access request originates. Add the Catalog Management service to that allowlist as a service reference. After you create a network zone, you can add it to a rule.

1. Install the [Context-based restrictions CLI plug-in](/docs/account?topic=account-cbr-plugin) by running the following command:

   ```sh
   ibmcloud plugin install cbr
   ```
   {: pre}

1. To create a network zone, use the [cbr zone-create](/docs/account?topic=account-cbr-plugin#cbr-cli-zone-create-command) command.


   The following example creates a network zone with a service reference. For more information, see [Service references](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis&interface=cli#service-attribute).

    ```sh
    ibmcloud cbr zone-create --name CatalogZone --description "Allow catalogs to interact with other services" --service-ref service_name=globalcatalog-collection
    ```
    {: pre}

    To find a list of available service references, run the [ibmcloud cbr service-ref-targets](/docs/account?topic=account-cbr-plugin#cbr-cli-service-ref-targets-command) command.
    {: tip}


### Example by using the API
{: #service-ref-cm-ex-api}
{: api}

By creating network zones, you establish a list of allowed locations where an access request originates. Add the Catalog Management service to that allowlist as a service reference. After you create a network zone, you can add it to a rule.

To create a network zone that includes the Catalog Management service, call the [Context-based restrictions API](/apidocs/context-based-restrictions#create-zone) as shown in the following example:

```sh
{
  "name": "Catalog zone",
  "description": "Allow catalogs to interact with other services",
  "addresses": [
    {
      "type": "serviceRef",
      "ref": {
        "service_name": "globalcatalog-collection"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

  .addresses(java.util.Arrays.asList(ipAddressModel, ipRangeAddressModel, subnetAddressModel, vpcAddressModel, serviceRefAddressModel))
  .excluded(java.util.Arrays.asList(excludedIPAddressModel))
  .build();

Response<Zone> response = contextBasedRestrictionsService.createZone(createZoneOptions).execute();
Zone zone = response.getResult();

System.out.println(zone);

## Creating network zones by using Terraform
{: #network-zones-create-terra}
{: terraform}

By creating network zones, you establish a list of allowed locations where an access request originates. Add the Catalog Management service to that allowlist as a service reference. After you create a network zone, you can add it to a rule.

To create a network zone, use the Terraform resource [cbr_zone](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/cbr_zone).

1. To install the Terraform CLI and configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform, follow the tutorial for [Getting started with Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started). The plug-in abstracts the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} APIs that are used to complete this task.
1. Create a Terraform configuration file that is named `main.tf`. In this file, you add the configuration to create a network zone by using HashiCorp Configuration Language. For more information, see the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language){: external}.

    The following example creates a network zone that allows a single IP address and explicitly excludes a single IP address.

    ```terraform
    resource "ibm_cbr_zone" "cbr_zone" {
      account_id = "12ab34cd56ef78ab90cd12ef34ab56cd"
      addresses {
            type = "serviceRef"
            value = "globalcatalog-collection"
      }
      description = "allow catalogs to interact with other services"
      name = "catalog zone"
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

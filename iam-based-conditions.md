# Limiting access with time and resource attribute-based conditions
{: #iam-time-based}

You can set up time-based conditions to designate temporary access to resources in your account or allow access to resources during specific time windows, and resource attribute-based conditions to avoid creating multiple access policies to meet your access needs.
{: shortdesc}

You can create time-based conditions that grant one-time temporary access for a specific time and date range, or you can set up recurring weekly access. For example, you might want to give a user access to account resources during only their working hours by specifying recurring access, or you might have a contractor or a user that needs to demo features of a service and they only need temporary access.

Time-based conditions don't account for Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes for time zones that observe DST. Administrators must update the policies according to DST changes to accurately enforce time-based conditions. For example, the Eastern time zone is UTC-4 hours during Daylight Saving Time rather than -5 hours as it is during standard time. Standard time begins in November and ends in March, when DST begins.
{: important}

The {{site.data.keyword.containershort}} doesn't adhere to time-based conditions. For example, a policy with a time-based condition that grants access to All Identity and Access enabled services includes access to {{site.data.keyword.containershort}} resources. The subject of the policy has access to some {{site.data.keyword.containershort}} resources outside of the specified time-based condition.
{: preview}

Time-based conditions for access policies help you apply the principle of least privilege for assigning access and reduce the attack surface if a security breach occurs.

When you create a policy with resource attribute-based conditions, you can avoid creating multiple access policies to meet your access needs. Instead, you can create a single policy by using a combination of `OR`/`AND` operators that are applied on resource attributes with literal or wildcard values. You can grant access to a resource that meets multiple criteria simultaneously (AND), or grant access if any of several conditions are met (OR). For example, with resource attribute-based conditions, you can create a single policy that allows access based on `Service instance: abc`, **OR** `attribute-1: xyz`, **OR** **(**`attribute-2: def` **AND** `attribute-3: hij`**)**.
{: shortdesc}

You must have a minimum of 2 conditions that use `OR`/`AND` and resource attribute-based conditions. If you need to add a single condition, see [Assigning access to resources in the console](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources&interface=ui#access-resources-console) and add the condition after selecting **Specific resources**.
{: note}

To review a user's access, see [Reviewing assigned access in the console](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources&interface=ui#review-your-access-console).

## Condition patterns
{: #condition-patterns}

### Time-based condition patterns
{: #time-condition-patterns}

The following patterns represent the allowed condition permutations:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| time-based-conditions:once | Temporary access on a specific day from 9 AM to 5 PM UTC-5. |
| time-based-conditions:weekly:all-day | Recurring access Mon-Fri UTC-5 all day. |
| time-based-conditions:weekly:custom-hours | Recurring access Mon-Fri 9 AM to 5 PM UTC-5. |
{: caption="Allowed condition patterns for time-based conditions." caption-side="top"}

IAM prevents combining one-time temporary conditions with weekly recurring conditions in the same policy definition.
{: note}

### Resource attribute-based condition patterns
{: #attribute-condition-patterns}

The following patterns represent the allowed condition permutations:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `attribute-based-condition:resource:literal-and-wildcard` |	Conditions based on resource attributes with literal or wildcard values (based on the operator used) |
{: caption="Allowed condition patterns for resource attribute-based conditions." caption-side="top"}



## Creating a temporary time-based condition by using the console
{: #iam-time-based-temp-ui}
{: ui}

You can assign access for a finite duration by specifying a date and time range that determines when the condition grants and terminates access. For example, you might have a user that needs to present a demonstration on your account for a few hours or a contractor that needs temporary access to a service over a couple days.
Complete the following steps to assign an access policy with a temporary time-based condition:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**
1. Select **Users**, **Trusted profiles**, **Service IDs**, or **Access groups**, depending on the entity to which you want to assign access.
1. Click the entity's name from the list and go to **Access**.
1. Click **Assign access**.
1. Select a service and click **Next**.
    * If you want the user to be able to create any service, select **All Identity and Access enabled services**.
    * If you want to assign the user access to a specific service, select it from the list.
1. Select the resource that you want to assign the user access to, or select All resources. Click **Next**.
1. (Optional) Select a resource group access role. Click **Next**.
1. Select any combination of service access and platform access roles, and click **Next**.
1. Click **Add condition** and select **One-time**.
1. Select the time zone.

    As an example, let's say that you're creating a conditional policy for a developer that is based in Dublin. In this case, select `UTC+1` so that the date and time range that you select in the next step enforces access at the correct time for that location.
    {: tip}

1. Complete the fields for the date and time range that that determines when the condition grants and terminates access.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Click **Review**.
1. Click **Add** to add your policy configuration to your policy summary.
1. Click **Assign**.

Temporary policies aren't automatically removed. To avoid reaching the policy limit in the account, administrators can remove the policy manually after it expires.
{: note}

For more information about time-based conditions for access policies, see [Conditions in access policies](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-condition-properties&interface=ui#policy-condition-properties).

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-time-based-cli}
{: cli}

Make sure that you have the latest version of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI so that you can use conditions in your access policies.

To determine your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI version, run the following command:

```bash
ibmcloud -v
```
{: codeblock}

You must use the latest version of the CLI. If you aren't using the latest version, run the following command to update your CLI:

```bash
ibmcloud update
```
{: codeblock}

If you are running the current release, the following output is displayed:

```bash
Checking for updates...
No update required. Your CLI is already up-to-date.
```
{: screen}

For more information, see [Installing the stand-alone IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

## Creating a temporary time-based condition by using the CLI
{: #iam-time-based-temp-cli}
{: cli}

You can assign access for a finite duration by specifying a date and time range that determines when the condition grants and terminates access. For example, you might have a user that needs to present a demonstration on your account for a few hours or a contractor that needs temporary access to a service over a couple days.
The following example shows you how to create a one-time time-based condition for you account by granting the user temporary access as an Operator for all Account Management Services.
1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CLI. If you have multiple accounts, you are prompted to select which account to use. If you do not specify a region with the `-r` flag, you must also select a region.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud login
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   If your credentials are rejected, you might be using a federated ID. To log in with a federated ID, use the `--sso` flag. See [Logging in with a federated ID](/docs/account?topic=account-federated_id) for more details.
   {: tip}

   If it's the first time you're using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI, check out the [getting started tutorial](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).

1. Create an access policy and assign it to a user or a service ID by using the command [**`ibmcloud iam user-policy-create`**](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_user_policy_create).
1. Assign access to **All Account Management services** with the `Operator` role:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam service-policy-create [your service ID here] --roles Operator --account-management --api-version v2
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Use the following example of a temporary time-based policy JSON schema to create your own conditions:

{: api}

Make sure that you call the `v2/policies` URI, which is `https://iam.coud.ibm.com/v2/policies`, so that you can use conditions in your access policies. For more information, see the [IAM Policy Management API](/apidocs/iam-policy-management) and [change log](/docs/account?topic=account-api-change-log).

## Creating a temporary time-based condition by using the API

## Creating a recurring time-based condition by using the console
{: #iam-time-based-recur-ui}
{: ui}

You can assign recurring access at a weekly cadence. You might want to give users access to account resources during only their working hours.
Complete the following steps to assign an access policy with a recurring time-based condition:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**
1. Select **Users**, **Trusted profiles**, **Service IDs**, or **Access groups**, depending on the entity to which you want to assign access.
1. Click the identity's name from the list and go to **Access**.
1. Click **Assign access**.
1. Select a service and click **Next**.
    * If you want the user to be able to create any service, select **All Identity and Access enabled services**.
    * If you want to assign the user access to a specific service, select it from the list.
1. Select the resource that you want to assign the user access to, or select All resources. Click **Next**.
1. (Optional) Select a resource group access role. Click **Next**.
1. Select any combination of service access and platform access roles, and click **Next**.
1. Click **Add condition** and select **Weekly**.
1. Select the time zone for the conditional policy.

    As an example, let's say that you're creating a conditional policy for a developer that is based in Dublin. In this case, select `UTC+1` so that the date and time range that you select next is enforced at the correct time for that location.
    {: tip}
 
1. Select the days of the week that you want the condition to grant access.
   * (Optional) Set the **All day** toggle to **No** to specify a timeframe for the days that you select.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Click **Review**.
1. Click **Add** to add your policy configuration to your policy summary.
1. Click **Assign**.

## Creating a recurring time-based condition by using the CLI
{: #iam-time-based-recur-cli}
{: cli}

You can assign recurring access at a weekly cadence. You might want to give users access to account resources during only their working hours.
The following example shows you how to create a recurring time-based condition for a user. The policy assigns access during working hours Monday through Friday as an Editor for all Account Management Services.
1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CLI. If you have multiple accounts, you are prompted to select which account to use. If you do not specify a region with the `-r` flag, you must also select a region.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud login
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   If your credentials are rejected, you might be using a federated ID. To log in with a federated ID, use the `--sso` flag. See [Logging in with a federated ID](/docs/account?topic=account-federated_id) for more details.
   {: tip}

   If it's your first time using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI, check out the [getting started tutorial](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).

1. Create an access policy and assign it to a user or a service ID by using the command [**`ibmcloud iam user-policy-create`**](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_user_policy_create).
1. Assign access to **All Account Management services** with the `Editor` role:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam service-policy-create [your service ID here] --roles Editor --account-management --api-version v2
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Use the following example of a recurring time-based policy JSON schema to create your own conditions:
   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam service-policy-create [your service ID here] --file [your JSON file name]
   ```

For more information about time-based conditions for access policies, see [Conditions in access policies](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-condition-properties&interface=ui#policy-condition-properties).

## Creating a resource attribute-based condition by using the console
{: #create-resource-attribute-condition}
{: ui}

You can assign access by specifying a resource attribute that determines which resources the condition grants access to. For example, you might have a user that needs to present a demonstration in your account by using specific resources. For more information and examples about available operators, see [Resource attribute-based conditions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-condition-properties&interface=ui#resource-based-conditions).

You can have up to 10 conditions and nesting up to 2 levels by using `OR`.
{: important}

Complete the following steps to assign an access policy with an attribute resource-based condition:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**
1. Select **Users**, **Trusted profiles**, **Service IDs**, or **Access groups**, depending on the entity to which you want to assign access.
1. Click the entity's name from the list and go to **Access**.
1. Click **Assign access**.
1. Select a service, and click **Next**.

   Not all services support resource attribute-based conditions. To continue, select a service that supports resource attribute-based conditions. For example, **Cloud Object Storage**.
   {: important}

1. Select the resource that you want to assign the user access to, or select **All resources**. Click **Next**.
1. (Optional) Select a resource group access role. Click **Next**.
1. Select any combination of service access and platform access roles, and click **Next**.
1. Click **Add condition** and select **Advanced condition builder** > **Next**.
1. Add the resource conditions and click **Create**.

As an example, let's say that you're creating a conditional policy for a developer that needs access to everything under the `dev/David/` and the `dev/Secret/` folders OR any path that begins with the `devOps/` or `cicd/`. In this case, select **Prefix**, **string matches any of**, and add `dev/David/*` and `dev/Secret/*`. Then, add an OR condition and select **Path**, **string matches any of**, and add `devOps/*` and `cicd/*`.
{: tip}

1. Click **Create**> **Review** > **Add** to add your access configuration to your access summary.
1. Click **Assign**.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-resource-based-api}
{: api}

Make sure that you call the `v2/policies` URI, which is `https://iam.coud.ibm.com/v2/policies`, so that you can use conditions in your access policies. For more information, see the [IAM Policy Management API](/apidocs/iam-policy-management) and [change log](/docs/account?topic=account-api-change-log).

## Creating resource attribute-based conditions by using the API
{: #create-resource-attribute-conditio-api}
{: api}

You can assign access by specifying a resource attribute that determines which resources the condition grants access to. As an example, let's say that you're creating a conditional policy for a developer that needs access to everything under the `dev/David/*` and the `devA/*` folders or any path that begins with the `dev/David/*` or `devA/*`. The following example shows you how to create a resource attribute-based condition that gives the user access to everything under the `dev/David/` folder and any path that begins with the `devA` or specifically `devA/` folder.

You can have up to 10 conditions and nesting up to 2 levels by using `OR`.

# Updating your profile
{: #usersettings}

In your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} profile, you can add a photo and personal information, manage notifications, and monitor your privacy. Setting it up helps your teammates know who you are and how you can help. You can also update your company profile details as each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account includes a company profile that contains company information and details about the primary account holder. You can use data from the company profile when you set up contacts and user profiles. You can have various account-specific contacts that are used in association with services available in the account. If you have administrative access or higher, you can update your company contact information.

## Editing your information
{: #ibmid}

If you log in with an IBMid, it is the single ID that you use to log in to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account for infrastructure, services, and application features. You can't change your IBMid, but you can edit your associated profile information, such as your name, email, phone number, password, or company name. In the console, go to the **{{site.data.keyword.avatar}}** icon ![Avatar icon](../icons/i-avatar-icon.svg "Avatar") > **Profile**. If you log in with a SoftLayer ID, you can also change your profile information from the Profile page.

If you log in with an ID from an external identity provider (IdP), then your information from your IdP is displayed. However, you can't update it on the Profile page. You must update your user information with your IdP.

## Changing your cookie settings
{: #tracking}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console requires cookies to manage your sessions, such as to provide secure login, handle transactions, and save some preferences. Additional cookies are used to build a more personalized experience for you and provide better support. If you change your cookie settings from the IBM standard default, you might not be able to use some features, such as chat communications.

To change your settings from the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} standard default, complete the following steps:
1. In the console, go to the **{{site.data.keyword.avatar}}** icon ![Avatar icon](../icons/i-avatar-icon.svg "Avatar") > **Privacy**.
1. Move the slider to select your level of allowed cookies.

   You can click **Advanced settings** to view the exact company and domain for the cookies in each level. Then, click **Basic settings** to return to cookie preference selection.

## Updating your company profile
{: #customer-profile}

To request an update to the company profile details, go to **Manage** > **Account** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, select **Company information**, and then select **Company profile**. After you request an update to the company profile, a classic infrastructure team member reviews the request. If any additional information is needed, our team asks for updates by updating the case. The following company profile fields must contain accurate information:

* Company Name
* Street Address 1
* Country
* State/Province (as needed)
* City
* Zip/Postal Code
* First Name of the primary account holder
* Last Name of the primary account holder
* Email address
* Phone

If your account is for personal use, you can use your first and last name as the Company Name.
{: tip}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} uses the information in the company profile to contact you. If your phone number or email changes, be sure to update them. The company profile information is entered when the account was created.

## Editing a company contact
{: #account-contact}

Company contacts are created when certain products or services are ordered. For example, when a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) report is requested or a domain is ordered, a company contact is created. To edit a company contact, go to **Manage** > **Account** in the console, select **Company information**, and then select **Company contacts**. Keep the information about the company contacts complete and up-to-date in case an inquiry is required.

Ensure that the company contacts are the appropriate people to be contacted for each type of request. You might have multiple contact entries for each account, but only one contact for each type of service. Company-specific contact information doesn't include the account profile, which is the primary contact information that is associated with an account.

Verify the information before you make the update. After you submit the new contact information, the company contacts are updated immediately.

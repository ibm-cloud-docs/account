When you claim profiles and controls, you must evaluate the resources that were created during validation to ensure compliance. To run a scan, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Security and Compliance** to access {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
2. In the navigation, click **Profile**.
3. Click the **Overflow** menu in the row of the profile that you want to evaluate and select **Run scan**.
4. Click **Run scan**.

After your scan completes, you can return to your private catalog to continue the onboarding process.

# Editing and duplicating a dashboard
{: #edit-dupe-dash}

Only the user that created the dashboard can edit it by adding, removing, and rearranging the widgets on the dashboard. You can duplicate a dashboard to include the same structure and layout without having to re-create the dashboard from scratch. All users with the dashboard link can duplicate the dashboard.

## Reorganizing widgets on your dashboard
{: #dash-reorg}

Customize your dashboard by grabbing a widget and moving it to fit your organization's needs. Only the user that created the dashboard can edit it.

For example, as an account owner, tracking who has access to your account might be a high priority for you. You want these details to be displayed at the beginning of your dashboard, but you must scroll to find the User access widget.

To reorganize a dashboard, complete the following steps:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions"), and select **Edit**.
1. Grab the widget to move it to the beginning of your dashboard.

## Adding widgets to your dashboard
{: #add-widgets}

A dashboard includes widgets that are configured to display specific information that is relevant to you and your team. If you need to add or remove widgets to fit your team's needs, grab a widget from the side panel or relete them within the widow. Only the user that created the dashboard can edit it.

To edit a dashboard, complete the following steps:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions"), and select **Edit**.
1. Use the dashboard panel to add and remove widgets, and adjust the scope of your resources. To view a list of the available widgets, see [Dashboard widgets](/account?topic=account-add-widgets#dashboard-widget).

You can't directly edit the default console dashboard. When you click **Edit** on the default console dashboard, a duplicate version is created that you can edit. You can return to the original default console dashboard by selected the dashboard with the default label.

## Duplicating a dashboard
{: #dash-dupe}

When you duplicated a dashboard, the layout of the widgets and content that is included in the notes widget will be duplicated. You must define the scope and dashboard access separately. The scope and assigned access is not saved from the dashboard that was duplicated. All users with the dashboard link can duplicate the dashboard.

# Why can't I apply a subscription code to my account?  
{: #troubleshoot-promo-enterprise}
{: troubleshoot}

A subscription code can't be added to the account because of specific access that is required.
{: shortdesc}

You can't add a subscription code to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account, because you don't have the correct access.  
{: tsSymptoms}

Because your account is a child account on the enterprise, you can't apply subscription codes. Subscription codes must be applied at the enterprise level.
{: tsCauses}

Contact the owner or the administrator of the enterprise to add the subscription code. When the subscription code is added, it applies to all accounts in the enterprise. For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).

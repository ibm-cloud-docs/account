1. Click the name of the private catalog that contains the product that you want to add details for.

   Filters
   :   Choose from the set of filters on compliance, delivery method, deployment target, pricing plan, and more. These filters are used to help users quickly find products relevant to their business needs.

   Industry
   :   Add up to five industry filters to target your product to specific users.

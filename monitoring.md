# Auditing events for account and catalogs management
{: #accttracking}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, and private catalogs.
{:shortdesc}

As of 9 May 2019 the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong}} service is deprecated. You must create an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} in your account to continue tracking account management events.

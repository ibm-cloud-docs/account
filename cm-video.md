# Catalog management on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #cm-video}

As an account owner, you can control your users' access to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, which contains over 350 products available for public use. You can hide the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog from all users, or apply filters to scope the products that are available. Within your account, private catalogs provide more fine-tuned control over access to products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
{: shortdesc}

Let's say you're an account administrator for your team, and you require access to all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. A member of your team is tasked with a specific project, for example, building a voice-enabled chatbot by using {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, {{site.data.keyword.speechtotextshort}}, and {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}}. And, you want them to access only those products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

To achieve this, you create one catalog that includes all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. Then, you create another catalog that includes only the required products, and you give the team member viewer access to the catalog.

For information about managing settings for all catalogs in your account, go to [Managing catalog settings](/docs/account?topic=account-filter-account&interface=ui).

For information about filtering the products that are available to users in your account, go to [Customizing the IBM Cloud catalog and private catalogs for users in your account](/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user&interface=ui).

When you're ready, head over to [Catalog management](/content-mgmt/overview){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to get started.

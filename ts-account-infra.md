# How can I access infrastructure services in my account?
{: #troubleshoot-infrastructure-access}
{: troubleshoot}

You're unable to access infrastructure services because your account isn't linked to an infrastructure account or it's a Lite account.
{: shortdesc}

When you attempt to access the infrastructure sections of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, the following message might be displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

```text
This page can't be loaded because your infrastructure account is not fully configured as an IBM Cloud account.
```

Multiple reasons why the message is displayed:
{: tsCauses}

* You have a [Lite account](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#liteaccount), which does not allow access to infrastructure services.
* Your account is not linked to an infrastructure account.

To resolve this issue, you must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. For more information, see [Upgrading your account](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account).
{: tsResolve}

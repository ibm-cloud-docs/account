# Transferring ownership of your account
{: #transfer}

You can transfer your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account to a different owner by creating a support case with information about the new owner. You can transfer only Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts.
{: shortdesc}

Every {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account must have a valid account owner. Accounts without a valid account owner are subject to suspension and possible termination.
{: note}

## Transferring an account that you own
{: #transfer-own}

As the account owner, you can transfer the account ownership only by creating a support case. This cannot be done by self-service.  The new owner must be an existing user within the account. If the person that you want to own the account isn't an existing user, [invite them to the account](/docs/account?topic=account-iamuserinv)before you create the support case.

To create the support case, click the **Help** icon ![Help icon](../icons/help.svg "Help") > **Support center** from the console menu bar, and click **Create a case**. In the case description, include the full name and IBMid of the user that is to be the new account owner. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support completes the ownership change as directed by the account owner.

When you transfer your account to a new owner, the previous account owner is automatically removed from the account. The new owner can invite the account's previous owner back to the transferred account as necessary. To ensure the security of the account, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support cannot modify the account's user list.
{: note}

## Transferring an account from another owner
{: #transfer-lost}

If the owner of an account leaves the company and there is a need to transfer the account, a new owner must be identified. Then, create a support case to request a transfer.

The new owner must have an IBMid or be a user of the account. If the user does not have an IBMid, the new owner must create the IBMid and be added to the account by another user.

In the support case to request an account transfer, you must attach an official document from your company that contains the following information.
- Your official company letterhead
- Your company's article of incorporation, if applicable
- A statement that the individual is no longer associated with your company
- An explanation that you want the account owner to be changed to a new owner
- The given name and surname of the new account owner
- The email address and phone number of the new account owner
- A signature of an executive at your company
- The account number of the account to transfer

When the ownership is transferred to the new owner, be aware that the previous account owner will be automatically removed from that account, and the new owner will have full access to the account. The new owner needs to invite the account's previous owner back to the account to keep them within it.
{: note}

   When you're logged in to the account, you can find the account number in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} menu bar next to the account name. For example, you might see `1234567 - IBM`, where the account number is 1234567.

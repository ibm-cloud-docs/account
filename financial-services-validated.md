# Enabling your account to use Financial Services Validated products
{: #enabling-fs-validated}

If you're the account owner, you can enable your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account to be Financial Services Validated designated, which means your account stores and manages regulated financial services information.
{: shortdesc}

If you have an account that's identified as a Financial Services account, you can use services that are designated as [IBM Cloud for Financial Services Validated](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about). Services that are designated as IBM Cloud for Financial Services Validated use the industry’s highest levels of encryption certification, provide preventive and compensatory controls for financial services regulatory workloads, multi-architecture support and proactive, and automated security.

Accounts that enable the Financial Services Validated setting can filter the catalog to view the services that adhere to this compliance standard and still have access to the full catalog of services. However, if anyone in the account chooses to create a service that isn't Financial Services Validated, a message displays with a reminder that this setting is enabled in the account and the selected service isn't Financial Services Validated.

After you enable the setting at the account level, you can filter the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog to display services that are designated as Financial Services Validated. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, expand the **Compliance** section and select **Financial Services Validated**. The Financial Services Validated label on a service can apply to all available plans or be limited to specific plans or configurations.

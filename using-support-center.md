## Requesting support for resources in the European Union
{: #eusupported}

European Union (EU) support is available to customers who choose to enable the EU supported setting. EU Support is provided 24 hours a day and 7 days a week by engineers that are located in Europe. Global teams provide support at the discretion of the EU support team. Global teams might be contacted, for example, when issues are not resolved by the Advanced Customer Support (ACS) team in the EU, and more expertise is needed.

You can specify that you want EU support for your account if the following criteria are true:

* The EU Supported setting is enabled for your account by the master user or account owner. For more information, see [Enabling the EU Supported setting](/docs/account?topic=account-eu-supported).
* Your resources are in the appropriate European data center. For more information, see [Data centers](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations#data-centers).
* You select the EU supported case level when you open the case.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform services that are hosted in the Frankfurt location must be supported by a team that is physically located in Europe.
{: note}

Enabling the EU Support setting for your account applies to all future cases that you open for issues on any service or data center that is hosted in the EU region. However, if you add resources outside of an EU data center or Frankfurt location, issues for those resources are not necessarily handled by a support team in Europe. Any cases that are opened before you enable the EU Supported setting aren't affected.

## {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} generally available service
{: #s-services-gaorcont}

Support is provided for problems that are determined to be a defect for services or container images that are generally available (GA) and provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. The case is addressed based on the severity that you assign. For more information, see [Case severity and initial response times](/docs/account?topic=account-support-case-severity).

You can change your current support plan at any time by contacting a [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} representative.
{: tip}

## {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} beta service
{: #s-services-betaorcont}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} releases services or container images that are classified as beta releases. These services are in a trial stage of development and they aren't production-ready. A beta release helps {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} development and marketing teams to assess the value of the service in the market. This assessment enables teams to make updates before the service is released as a GA service or container image.

If the root cause analysis determines the issue is a defect in the beta service or container image, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. Additionally, the case is assigned the appropriate 3 or 4 severity level.

## Third-party services
{: #s-services-3p}

Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. These services are provided by individual software entities, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partners, or independent software vendors (ISV).

Support for third-party services is provided by the service provider. This includes third-party products that are deployed by using the {{site.data.keyword.terraform-provider_full_notm}}. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. However, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} shares analysis with the third-party service provider, if needed, and can work through Marketplace with the third-party service to help solve the issue.

## Open source or community service
{: #s-services-osorcomserv}

Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} closes the case and refers you to the community or forum for assistance. You can get community assistance for technical issues through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud){: external}.

# Customizing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog and private catalogs for users in your account
{: #restrict-by-user}

Private catalogs provide a way to centrally manage access to products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog and your own catalogs. You can customize the public catalog and your private catalogs to make specific solutions available to users in your account. By doing so, you can ensure that your catalogs are relevant to your business.

## Creating a private catalog with all products included by using the console
{: #catalog-all-ui}
{: ui}

Complete the following steps to create a catalog that includes all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **Create a catalog**.
1. Select the Product (default) catalog type.
1. Enter a name and description.
1. Make sure the **All products** option is selected, and click **Create**. The availability is based on the filters set at the account level on the [Settings page](/content-mgmt/catalog-settings){: external}.
1. Confirm that the catalog includes all products by clicking the catalog name > **Manage filters**. Then, check that **Include all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** is selected in **Step 1: Select to include or exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog**.

## Creating a private catalog with select products included by using the console
{: #catalog-select-ui}
{: ui}

Complete the following steps to create a catalog that includes a specific set of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **Create a catalog**.
1. Select the Product (default) catalog type.
1. Enter a name and description.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Click the catalog name > **Manage filters**.
1. Select **Exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** in **Step 1: Select to include or exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog**.
1. Skip step 2, and click **Add** in **Step 3: Add exceptions to the rules**.
1. Make sure **Include** is selected as the condition, and then individually select the products you want users to access. In the case of our example project, you select {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, {{site.data.keyword.speechtotextshort}}, and {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}}.

## Setting the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog by using the console
{: #catalog-off-ui}
{: ui}

Now that you've created your private catalogs, complete the following steps to turn off visibility of the public catalog to all users in your account.

1. Click **Catalogs** in the breadcrumb.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Set **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** to **Off**.

   

4. Confirm that your filters and settings are correctly applied by going to the public catalog, and expanding the catalog switcher. Only the private catalogs in your account should be displayed in the list.

You can update which products are included or excluded at any time by updating your private catalog's settings.
{: note}

## Branding your private catalog with a custom banner
{: #customer-banner}

You can enhance the look and feel of your private catalog to match your brand by adding a custom image to your private catalog's banner. All users who are given access to your private catalog can see the custom banner when they go to the private catalog to search for products, instead of the default {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} banner. To add a custom banner image, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, then click **Private catalogs**.
1. Click the **Overflow menu** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") on the row of the private catalog that you want to add a banner for, then click **Edit**.
1. Add a URL to your custom banner in the **Catalog banner** field, or you can click **Upload** to add an image directly.
   
   The maximum recommended image size is 944 x 260 pixels.
   {: tip}

1. Click **Update**.
1. Then, go to the [catalog](/catalog), and select your private catalog from the list to view the updated look and feel of your private catalog.

You can also customize the provider name for private catalog products that you add to your catalogs. By default, they display with `Community` as the provider, which is a filter in the catalog, but you can customize this to be your company or organization's name. For more information, see [Providing catalog entry details](/docs/account?topic=account-cm-catalog-details#cm-catalog-entry).
{: tip}

## Authorizing access to private catalogs by using the console
{: #custom-catalog-access-ui}
{: ui}

To authorize users to work with the products in your private catalogs, assign them the [viewer role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#catalog-management-account-management).

## Deleting a private catalog by using the console
{: #delete-private-catalog-ui}
{: ui}

If you delete a private catalog, all of the products within the catalog are deleted as well. Complete the following steps to delete a private catalog:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **Private catalogs**.
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg "Actions") for the catalog you want to delete, and select **Delete**.

You can [restore a private catalog](/docs/account?topic=account-resource-reclamation&interface=cli#restore-resource-cli) within 7 days after you delete it.

{: tip}

## Creating a private catalog by using Terraform
{: #catalog-all-terraform}
{: terraform}

You cannot customize the public catalog and your private catalogs to make specific solutions available to users in your account by using Terraform. To customize the public catalog and your private catalogs, switch to the UI, CLI, or API steps.
{: important}

Use the following steps to create a private catalog:

1. Create an argument in your `main.tf` file. The following example creates a catalog by using the `ibm_cm_catalog` resource, where `label` is a display name to identify the catalog.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_cm_catalog" "cm_catalog" {
   label = "label"
   short_description = "short_description"
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   For more information, see the argument reference details on the [Terraform Catalog Management](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/cm_catalog){: external} page.

1. After you finish building your configuration file, initialize the Terraform CLI. For more information, see [Initializing Working Directories](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/init){: external}.

   ```terraform
   terraform init
   ```
   {: pre}

1. Provision the resources from the `main.tf` file. For more information, see [Provisioning Infrastructure with Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/run){: external}.

   1. Run `terraform plan` to generate a Terraform execution plan to preview the proposed actions.

      ```terraform
      terraform plan
      ```
      {: pre}

   1. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources that are defined in the plan.

      ```terraform
      terraform apply
      ```
      {: pre}

## Authorizing access to private catalogs by using Terraform
{: #customcatalog-access-terraform}
{: terraform}

To authorize users to work with the products in your private catalogs, assign them the [viewer role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services&interface=terraform#api-acct-mgmt).

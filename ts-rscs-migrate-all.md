# Why can't I migrate all of my services?
{: #ts_service_migration}
{: troubleshoot}

Not all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} services are eligible for migration. 
{: shortdesc}

You're unable to migrate certain services.  
{: tsSymptoms}

Services that can't be added to resource groups and aren't managed by using Identity and Access Management (IAM) can't be migrated. If a service is not eligible, there isn't an option for migration. 
{: tsCauses}

Check the services to confirm they're eligible for migration. You receive a notification and a **Migrate** icon ![Migrate icon](../icons/migrate.svg "Migrate this service instance to a resource group") is displayed to indicate if a service is eligible for migration.
{: tsResolve}

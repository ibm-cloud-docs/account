# How can I get access to invite users to the account?
{: #troubleshoot-invite}
{: troubleshoot}

You must have specific access to invite users to an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account if you aren't the account owner. Without the correct access, you can't invite users to an account.

When you click **Invite users**, the following message might be displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

> Looks like you don't have access to invite users. You must be assigned the editor or administrator role for the User management service. Contact your account owner for access.

You aren't assigned the correct access.
{: tsCauses}

To invite users and manage outstanding invitations, you must be an account owner, an organization manager, a user with an IAM access policy with the Editor role or higher on the user management account management service, or you must have classic infrastructure permissions to add users.
{: tsResolve}

To review your assigned access in the account, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**, and select **Users**.
2. Select your name.
3. Review the assigned access in the **Access** tab.

If you aren't assigned the correct access, contact the account owner. After you have the correct access, go to **Manage > Access (IAM)**, then select **Users**, and click **Invite users** to add users to the account.

If you're the account owner and can't invite users, contact [Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.

* If you have a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can click **Live chat with support**.

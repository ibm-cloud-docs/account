# How do I add a credit card when the option isn't available through the console?
{: #ts-ccibm}
{: troubleshoot}

You're unable to add a credit card in the console because your payments are managed through IBM.com.
{: shortdesc}

If your payments are managed outside of the console, you can't use [Billing and usage](/billing){: external} to add a credit card.
{: important}

You want to enter a credit card to pay for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services, but the option doesn't appear.
{: tsSymptoms}

When you try to enter your credit card information, you see the following message:

`Your payments are managed through IBM.com. To view your payments and maintain your billing, you can visit the IBM.com portal which contains everything for your IBMid account.`

You click **Explore** to access the ibm.com website, but you don't see a location to enter your credit card information.

Credit card transactions are securely processed through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. However, in some countries, additional steps are taken to ensure the integrity of the credit card data. Those credit card requests are completed through the ibm.com website. Both methods ensure that your credit card information is securely processed.

To provide your credit card information for payment, complete the following steps:

# Viewing notifications
{: #viewing-notifications}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [Notifications page](/notifications){: external} is a centralized place to view and control all incidents, maintenance, announcements, and security bulletins. Events that are displayed on the Notifications page are ones that specifically impact users based on the preferences that the account owner or administrator sets. You can also view events from the past year that are now completed on the [History page](/status/history){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

Pages specific to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} classic infrastructure are deprecated. The new Notifications page hosts all classic infrastructure notifications. You can view classic infrastructure history for planned and unplanned incidents and announcements on the Notifications page.

To view the page, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, and click the **Notifications** icon ![Notification icon "Notifications"](../icons/Notification.svg) on the menu bar.

The new notification experience provides enhancements to how users are notified about important changes on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform:

* The Notifications page is account that is scoped and shows only notifications for the account that is selected on the menu bar. You can switch accounts to view notifications that are affecting a different account.
* The severity or impact is listed for each notification type. Depending on the notification, you might see severity 1 listed for an unplanned incident notification and high impact that is listed for a planned maintenance notification.
* You can use the search field to locate a specific notification or filter by a notification type.

## Getting advanced notice for disruptive maintenance
{: #disruptive-maintenance}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tries to limit disruptive, required maintenance for Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Software as a Service offerings. Most maintenance is done in a nondisruptive manner to avoid the impact to your business, but when disruptive maintenance is necessary, we provide as much advanced notice as possible.

### Iaas
{: #iaas}

For IaaS offerings, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides advanced notice that's dependent on the severity of the impact. The following table defines the types and levels of the possibility of an impact.

| High                  | Certain, likely, or has the potential to cause an extended or brief service disruption. | a minimum of 30 days |
| Medium                | Low to moderate possibility of a brief disruption. | a minimum of 21 days |
| Low                   | None to negligible chance of a disruption or routine change. No assumed risk or a disruption that is isolated to a single customer. | offering-specific |

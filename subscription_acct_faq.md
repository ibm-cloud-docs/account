# FAQ for subscription accounts
{: #faq-subscription-account}

FAQ for subscription accounts include entries about subscription credit, subscription terms, and other subscription-related self-help information. To find all FAQ for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](/docs/faqs).
{: shortdesc}

## How do I add subscription credit to my account?
{: #subscriptioncode}
{: faq}
{: support}

After you purchase a subscription, you'll receive an email with a subscription code that adds the credit to your account. To apply the subscription code, go to [Account settings](/account/settings), and click **Apply code**. You can also apply your code to a new account by clicking **Register with a code** when you [sign up for a new account](/registration). For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/account?topic=account-subscriptions).

You might be looking for information about promo codes and feature codes. For more information, see [Managing promotions](/docs/account?topic=account-applying-promo-codes) and [Applying feature codes](/docs/account?topic=account-codes).

## What does the IN_PROGRESS status mean when I apply a subscription code?
{: #pending-code}
{: faq}

When you apply a subscription code to a Pay-As-You-Go account, the status of the subscription might be IN_PROGRESS. This status indicates that your account must be reviewed to complete your order. When you see this status, contact the IBM Cloud Sales representative who helped you with the order.

## Can I pay the total spending commitment up-front or quarterly?
{: #subs-pay-schedule}
{: faq}

Yes. By default, you're billed monthly for your subscriptions. If you'd like to pay up-front or quarterly, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external}.

## Can I spend more or less than my monthly commitment?
{: #subs-spending}
{: faq}

Yes, what you spend monthly is up to you. You can spend any amount of the total commitment each month.

## What happens if I spend my entire subscription amount before my term ends?
{: #subs-spend-before-term-end}
{: faq}

You're required to continue paying your monthly charges until the end of your term. You're charged the non-discounted rate for any usage that goes over your total subscription amount. To avoid overage charges, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} to sign up for a new subscription.

The Enterprise Savings Plan model is similar to the Subscription model. Unlike a subscription, when you have a commitment, you commit to spend a certain amount and receive discounts across the platform even after your commitment term ends.

## Is there a monthly minimum amount required for Subscription accounts?
{: #subs-minimum}
{: faq}

Yes, your subscription must have a combined minimum spending and term commitment of $100.00 USD each month for 12 months.

## Can I cancel my Subscription account before the end of my term commitment?
{: #subs-cancel-early}
{: faq}

A subscription is a contract between you and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} that commits you to use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} for a specific term and spending amount. You can request to cancel your subscription before the end of the term, but whether the subscription can be canceled is at the discretion of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. Any remaining credit on your subscription might be forfeited. For more information, contact [Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}. Make sure that you provide details about why you need to cancel your subscription.

To close a Pay-As-You-Go account or a Lite account, see [How can I close my account?](/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#cancelaccount).

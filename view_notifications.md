## Getting advanced notice for disruptive maintenance
{: #disruptive-notice-maintenance}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tries to limit disruptive, required maintenance for Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Software as a Service offerings. Most maintenance is done in a nondisruptive manner to avoid the impact to your business, but when disruptive maintenance is necessary, we provide as much advanced notice as possible.

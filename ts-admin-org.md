# Why can't administrators use the console to view all orgs?
{: #ts_ui_org}
{: troubleshoot}

As an administrator, you can't display every organization to administer them when you use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. You can display and administer only those organizations to which you belong.

As an administrator, you can't view all the organizations from the console.
{: tsSymptoms}

This behavior is a limitation of the console.
{: tsCauses}

You can use commands such as `ibmcloud account orgs` and `ibmcloud account org-create` from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command-line interface to manage all the organizations.
{: tsResolve}

For a full list of commands, enter `ibmcloud account help`.

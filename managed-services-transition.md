# Legacy {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Managed Services offering transition
{: #legacy-managed-services-transition}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is transitioning its Managed Services support offering, a legacy offering, from managed by IBM to managed by Wanclouds, an IBM partner, or to self-managed by the client. The effective date for this change is 1 January 2025. In most cases, changes, where changes may be needed, will be minor and should not interrupt your operations.

If you use the Managed Services offering, you should [open a support case](/docs/account?topic=account-open-case&interface=ui) in the Support Center no later than 1 November 2024 to provide information on which transition option you choose and to coordinate with IBM on the changes. Because IBM requires a minimum of eight weeks to transition or enable the clients, either opting in or out, IBM requests your decision by November 1st.

As this transition approaches, help is available to assist you. If you have questions, contact us by opening a support case or by reaching out to your IBM representative in Technical Account Management (TAMs), Client Services (CSMs), or Sales for assistance.

## Transition approach and options
{: #transition-approach}

You have the following options for this transition:

- Opt in to partner with Wanclouds and to transition your management of a managed hosting environment to Wanclouds
- Opt out to a self-managed environment that you manage yourself
- Opt out to a self-managed environment with a self-appointed business partner

## Timeline
{: #timeline}

The following table describes important dates that you need to be aware of if you use the Managed Services support offering.

| Date | Managed Services transition milestone |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| 26 August 2024 | Affected clients received a notification dated 26 August 2024 with information on this change |
| 1 November 2024 | Last date to open a support case with your transition decision |
| 30 November 2024 | Last date to add servers to the existing setup and have them be included in the transition |
| 1 January 2025 | - IBM no longer provides a managed level of support for server, security, storage, and database management services that were in scope as part of the Managed Services offering \n - IBM is no longer able to log into your devices with IBM’s administrative domain accounts.  IBM demotes and removes its controllers and services from the client’s domain as part of the decommission. \n Any remaining billing for the Managed Services offering ends. Billing for devices continues within the normal IBM billing process. \n Any remaining domain-based resources that were not transitioned might begin to experience failures because the infrastructure will be disabled \n - If you opt in to partnering with Wanclouds the domain moves to and remains on the Wanclouds controllers without impact or interruption \n - If you opt out to a self-managed environment the responsibility for managing the devices reverts solely to you as self-managed devices |

## Steps for opting in with Wanclouds
{: #opt-in-wanclouds}

You can expect the following tasks to be part of the transition to partnering with Wanclouds:

- The client will confirm their intent to opt in via a proactive support case.
- As soon as the case is created TAMs/CSM will reach out to the clients and initiate a kickoff call along with IBM & Wanclouds.
- IBM will configure servers that Wanclouds deploy on their own account and promote them to Domain Controllers for the management domain, which will automatically sync the current domain information to them as well as propagate any changes that may get made at any point through the overall customer transition process.
- This approach will ensure that Clients and IBM won’t have to recreate any users or worry about passwords being correct, as the current/existing information will be synced up and will be same (similar to the existing client setup).
- IBM will work with Clients and Wanclouds to ensure any access or rules that may need to be created or updated to allow Wanclouds’ admins the ability to manage these devices for the customer, as well as network communication between the customer’s environment and Wanclouds, is set up and verified.
- To enact the transition, at a time scheduled with the Client IBM will assign the customer’s subnets to a zone defined within the management domain for the Wanclouds controllers and change the DNS servers on the customer’s servers to point to the Wanclouds controllers.
- These actions do not require a reboot or cause interruption, and we would verify proper connectivity between the customer and Wanclouds servers beforehand.
- IBM will not remove anything on its end, so in the unlikely event of unexpected results, reverting for investigation, if necessary, will be seamless.
- IBM will also remove its monitoring agents (Zabbix), which will not impact servers.
- Effective January 1st, 2025, IBM will no longer be able to log into client devices with our Administrative domain accounts, and any remaining domain-based resources will begin to experience failures (if the above steps are not executed) as the infrastructure will be disabled.
- On January 31st, 2025 IBM will demote and remove our controllers and servers from the domain as part of our decommission, and the domain will remain on the Wanclouds controllers without impact or interruption.

## Steps for opt out to self-managed
{: #opt-out-self-manage}

You can expect the following tasks to be part of the transition to a self-managed environment:

- The client will confirm their intent to opt out via a proactive support case.
- As soon as the case is created TAMs/CSM will reach out to the clients and initiate a kickoff call along with IBM & Wanclouds.
- For clients Opting out, there will be a discovery phase to understand the client setup and plan next steps.
- Once Client confirms their intent to opt out, IBM will work with the Client to identify which users are active on which servers and where they need to be recreated locally.
- Clients will need to identify what resources, such as users, they are using from our management Active Directory domain, mhsl01.mhsl.local (already known to the client), and replace them with their own users.
- IBM will provide a list of users that have been created for each account, as requested.
- Once confirmed and acknowledged by the client, IBM will remove the servers from our domain and client will be able to self-manage these servers basis of the users created locally.
- For Windows servers moving the servers from IBM domain will require at least one reboot.  For Linux it is not necessary, but IBM recommends to schedule a reboot for validation.
- Clients who already have their own domain servers configured will not be required to go through above steps of user identification and domain transfer.
- IBM will also remove its monitoring agents (Zabbix), which will not impact servers.
- Once client confirms and acknowledges the above steps  the fees for the monitoring service will be removed.
- Effective January 1st, 2025, IBM will no longer be able to log into client devices with our Administrative domain accounts, and any remaining domain-based resources will begin to experience failures as the infrastructure is disabled.
- On January 31st, 2025 IBM will demote and remove our controllers and servers from the domain as part of our decommission, and the domain will remain on the Wanclouds controllers without impact or interruption.

# Scenario: Estimating costs of a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} App with an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Database and Observability Tools
{: #sample}

Assume that you deployed your web application on to {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}}. The {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} uses several services that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} including a database, logging and monitoring. You can learn how the actual cost of your application is calculated in this example.
{: shortdesc}

With {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} you pay for only the memory and CPU needed to run your application, and any incoming HTTP calls. It includes [scaling to 0](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-scale#app-scale-boundaries), if your application doesn't receive any traffic for a span of time. For example, assume a production application, which is always running, and the application has the following specifications:

- The application is configured with 1 vCPU and 4 GB of memory (default for apps and jobs).
- The application receives 5 million HTTP requests in 30 days.
- The application uses an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Standard plan with:
- 150 GB of data storage (130 GB over the zero-cost 20 GB)
    - 1,000 lookups per second
    - 500 writes per second
    - 50 queries per second
- The application uses {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} Standard plan for log storage and search.
    - The application needs 7 days of fast search
    - The logs are retained in for 3 months in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
- The application uses {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} for performance metrics.
   - Only platform-metrics from {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} are needed

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} includes a zero-cost tier, and {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Standard plan includes 20 GB of zero-cost storage so you can experiment before you commit.

The prices that are used in this example are in US currency and do not reflect current prices or include any discounts or promo codes. For the most up-to-date prices, see [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} pricing](/codeengine/overview#pricing), [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} pricing](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricing), [{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} pricing](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-service_plans), and [{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} pricing](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-pricing_plans).

## Pricing scenario
{: #pricing-scenario}

The following table provides an example of estimated pricing for running an application in {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} that uses {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Standard plan as a data store, along with {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is also needed to query log data older than 7 days. The scenario assumes the following usage pattern:

## Calculation details
{: #calculation-details}

## {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} Calculation details
{: #codeengine-cost-details}

The following calculations include the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} zero-cost tier allocations, which include:
{: #code-engine-free-tier}

* 100,000 vCPU seconds per month
* 200,000 GB seconds of memory per month
* 100,000 HTTP requests per month

### vCPU
{: #vCPU}

```text
1 vCPU * 24 hours * 30 days * 3600 seconds = 2,592,000 vCPU seconds
Free tier: 100,000 vCPU seconds
Billable: 2,592,000 - 100,000 = 2,492,000 vCPU seconds
2,492,000 * $0.00003431 = $85.50
```

### Memory
{: #memory}

```text
4 GB * 24 hours * 30 days * 3600 seconds = 10,368,000 GB seconds
Free tier: 200,000 GB seconds
Billable: 10,368,000 - 200,000 = 10,168,000 GB seconds
10,168,000 * $0.00000356 = $36.20
```

### HTTP Requests
{: #http-requests}

```text
5,000,000 requests total
Free tier: 100,000 requests
Billable: 5,000,000 - 100,000 = 4,900,000 requests
4,900,000 * ($0.538 / 1,000,000) = $2.64
```

## {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Calculation details
{: #cloudant-cost-details}

In this scenario, we are using 150 GB of storage. With 20 GB of free data storage included, we pay for the additional 130 GB. The lookups, writes, and queries are charged based on the provisioned capacity in their respective increments.
For more detailed information about {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} pricing, see {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Pricing.
{: #cloudant-pricing-details}

### Standard plan - Data
{: #standardplan-data}

```text
150 GB total, 20 GB free, 130 GB charged
130 GB * $1.00 per GB = $130.00
```

### Standard plan - Lookups
{: #standardplan-lookups}

```text
1,000 Lookups/second / 100 Lookups/second = 10 units
10 * $0.25 per 100 Lookups/second = $2.50
```

### Standard plan - Writes
{: #standardplan-writes}

```text
500 Writes/second / 50 Writes/second = 10 units
10 * $0.50 per 50 Writes/second = $5.00
```

### Standard plan - Queries
{: #standardplan-queries}

```text
50 Queries/second / 5 Queries/second = 10 units
10 * $5.00 per 5 Queries/second = $50.00
```

## {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} Calculation details
{: #cloud-logs-cost-details}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} supports [tiering of your log data](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-tco-optimizer) to help optimize your logging costs while still being able to search and analyze applications log data. In this scenario, log data is stored in the initial default of 7-day retention in Priority Insights. After 7-days, the log data will be queried from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} at the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} rates. It is assumed that logs are retained for 3 months in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

Estimated Monthly log volume: 1 KB per request * 5,000,000 requests/month * 1 months = 5 GB

**Standard plan - Priority insights - 7 days:**

```text
5 GB * $1.20 per GB = $6.00
```

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Calculation details
{: #calculation-detail}

### Standard plan (us-south)
{: #standardplan}

3 months of logs: 1 KB per request * 5,000,000 requests/month * 3 months = 15 GB

Storage capacity:
15 GB * $0.0230 per GB/month = $0.36

Public outbound bandwidth:
Allowance: 100% of storage in GB = 15 GB
Actual usage: 15 GB
15 GB â‰¤ 15 GB allowance, so no additional charge

### Class A requests (write operations)
{: #classAreq}

Allowance: 100 x storage in GB = 100 x 15 = 1500 requests
Actual usage: Assuming that a file writes every 10 min; 43800 minutes/month / 10 minutes = 4380
4,380 > 1500 allowance, but the charge applies for 1,000 requests
Billable requests: 4,380 - 1,500 = 2880
2880 * ($0.0052 / 1,000) = $0.014976 (rounded to $0.01 due to low value)

### Class B requests (read operations)
{: #classsBreq}

Allowance: 1000 x storage in GB = 1000 x 15 = 15,000 requests
Actual usage: Assume that 3 files are read. For every file that is written in a month, 4,380 * 3 = 13140
13,140 < 15,000 allowance, but the charge applies for 10,000 requests
Billable requests: Less than the allowance, so no charge

Total {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} cost: $0.36 + $0.00 + $0.01 + $0.00 = $0.37

## {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} Calculation details
{: #cloud-monitoring-pricing-details}

Monitoring of {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} is enabled by using platform metrics. Platform metrics {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} are charged by using the tiered pricing based on the number of time-series hours metrics. For more examples on billing, see [Billing samples](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-pricing_plans#billing_example).

For platform metrics {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} charges based on the number of time-series metrics:

```text
time-series metrics: $0.08 USD per metric
```

In this scenario, assume 110 time-series metrics (50 for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} and 60 for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}).

### Time-series Metrics
{: #time-series-metrics}

[{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-monitor#metrics-by-plan) and [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-monitor-ibm-cloud-pm#metrics_dictionary-pm) provide various platform metrics to monitor your applications. The number of time-series depends on the [cardinality](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-monitor/using-monitor/metrics/using-labels/#cardinality){: external}, or number of unique time series associated with a metric. In this scenario, we are assuming 60 time-series for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} and 50 time-series for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

```text
Code Engine: 60 time-series/month
IBM Cloudant: 50 time-series/month
Total: 110 time-series/month * 730 hours/month = 
110 * $0.08 per metric = $8.80
```

# Restoring a deprecated private product or version
{: #restore-deprecated-product}

After you deprecate your product or version, your software enters a 90-day deprecation period before it is removed from users. During this 90-day deprecation period, you can restore your product or version to its last published state. Your software cannot be restored after the 90-day deprecation period.

The process to sell third-party software is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If you have questions, contact us at cloud.onboarding@us.ibm.com.

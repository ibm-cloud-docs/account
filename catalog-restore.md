# Restoring a deprecated private product or version
{: #restore-deprecated-product}

After you deprecate your product or version, your software enters a 90-day deprecation period before it is removed from users. During this 90-day deprecation period, you can't make changes to your product or version, but you can restore your product or version to its last published state. Your software cannot be restored after the 90-day deprecation period.

Complete the following steps to restore your product or version: 

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, click **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Private catalogs**.
1. Select the private catalog where your product is located.
1. Select your product. 
1. Optionally, if you want to restore a specific version of your software, select that version from the list.
   
   If your software has only one published version, and you restore that version, the entire product is restored.

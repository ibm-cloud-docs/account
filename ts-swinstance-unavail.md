# Why is my software instance not usable?
{: #ts-swinstance-unavail}
{: troubleshoot}

When a software product is removed or temporarily suspended from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog, any related software instances are not usable.
{: shortdesc}

When you access your software instance from your resource list, the following error message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

> The instance is not usable.

This problem happens if the software product that is used to create the instance is removed or suspended from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. Suspension is a temporary state while removal is permanent. In both states, the software instance cannot retrieve necessary information from the product, including updates for new features and fixes for vulnerabilities.
{: tsCauses}

In the case of the software being removed from the catalog, you should delete your instance. If necessary, you can create a new instance from a different software product in the catalog.
{: tsResolve}

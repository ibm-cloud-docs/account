# Escalating support cases
{: #escalation}

You can use the escalation process to surface critical issues and voice your concern about a support case. When a case is escalated, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team reviews the information in the support case and responds with appropriate updates. For information about case severity, see [Case severity and initial response times](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity).

To escalate a case, complete the following steps:

1. Contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support by chat or by phone.
   * Click **Chat with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}** in the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} to connect with a support agent 
   * Connect by phone using the number in the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.
1. Provide your existing case number and a request to escalate the case.
1. Provide the justification an escalation and explain the business impact of your problem or issue.

Basic support plans: If you have a Basic support plan, access to support is through cases only. If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider upgrading to a Premium or Advanced support plan so you assign a severity level to a case. To upgrade your support plan, contact a [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} representative.

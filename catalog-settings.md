# Managing catalog settings
{: #filter-account}

As the account owner or administrator, you can manage the settings for all catalogs across your account. Management tasks include setting the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog and controlling access to products in the public catalog and private catalogs for users in your account. You can also  follow the changes that have been made to your private catalogs with audit logs. Changes to your private catalog are associated with your account, products, and catalog.
{: shortdesc}

All private catalogs that are in an account inherit filters that are set by the account owner or administrator at the account level. In addition, if the account is a parent account in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enterprise, the filters apply to all child account groups and accounts.
{: tip}

## Before you begin
{: #set-before-begin}

1. Verify that you're using a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. See [Viewing your account type](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#view-acct-type) for more details.
1. Verify that you have the [administrator role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#catalog-management-account-management).
1. If you want users to have access to products in your account, make sure that you [create a private catalog](/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user&interface=ui) before you update the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog visibility setting.
1. To view the audit logs, you need to be a manager of the account the catalog is in, or an editor in that account and the catalog. See [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services) for more information.

## Updating the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog by using the console
{: #set-public-visibility}
{: ui}

Users in your account have access to all products in the public catalog by default. If you turn off the visibility of the public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, users can't use the console to create instances of products unless you give them access to a private catalog in your account.
To update what products are visible to users, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Settings > Set the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog in this account** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

This setting also controls visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} module registry and community registry. For more information, see [Open source offerings](/docs/overview?topic=overview-whatis-platform#solutions-open-source).

Some products aren't affected by catalog visibility settings. Users can create instances of these products by using an API or the CLI. For more information, see [Known issues and limitations](/docs/account?topic=account-known-issues).
{: important}

## Managing access to products for all users by using the console
{: #set-account-filters}
{: ui}

You can use filters to manage which products in the public catalog are available to all users in your account. For example, you might want to restrict access to third-party products. Or, you might want users to work with a specific software type. If your account is a parent account in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enterprise, the filters that you set apply to all child account groups and accounts. For more information, see [Customizing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog for an enterprise](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-catalog-enterprise-restrict&interface=ui).

1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Settings** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
2. Confirm that the visibility of the public catalog is set to **On**.
3. In the What products are available? section, select **Exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog**.
4. Set one or more [filters](#catalog-filters-customize) to customize what products are available by category.
5. (Optional) Add exceptions to the filter rules that you set in the previous step.
6. Use the **Preview** table to confirm your selections, and click **Update**.

## Managing access to products for specific users in the console
{: #set-private-filters}
{: ui}

Set filters at a private catalog level for fine-grained control of which products in the public catalog are available only to the users you choose.
1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, **Private catalogs** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
2. Select a catalog from the list to navigate to its details page.

   The **Products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** table that's displayed on the page shows the list of products that are available at the account level. The availability is based on the filters the account owner or administrator set. Account-level filters apply to all the private catalogs in the account.
   {: tip}

3. Click **Manage filters**.
4. Select to include or exclude all products in the public catalog.
5. Set one or more [filters](#catalog-filters-customize) to customize what products are available by category.
6. (Optional) Add exceptions to the filter rules that you set in the previous step.
7. Click **Update**.
8. Go to the Settings page and turn off the visibility of the public catalog.
9. To give users access to work with the products in the private catalog, assign them the [viewer role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#catalog-management-account-management).

For more detailed examples of how you can leverage filtering at the private catalog level, see [Customizing your private catalogs](/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user).

## Updating the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog by using the CLI
{: #set-public-visibility-cli}
{: cli}

Users in your account have access to all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public catalog by default. You can make products available only to the users you choose by turning off visibility to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog and adding the products to your private catalogs.

This setting also controls visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} module registry and community registry. For more information, see [Open source offerings](/docs/overview?topic=overview-whatis-platform#solutions-open-source).

Use the following command to turn off visibility of the public catalog to all users in your account.

```bash
ibmcloud catalog filter hide-ibm-public-catalog
```
{: codeblock}

## Managing access to products for all users by using the CLI
{: #set-account-filters-cli}
{: cli}

You can use filters to manage which products in the public catalog are available to all users in your account. For example, you might want to restrict access to third-party products. Or, you might want users to work with a specific software type.
If your account is a parent account in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enterprise, the filters that you set apply to all child account groups and accounts. For more information, see [Customizing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog for an enterprise](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-catalog-enterprise-restrict&interface=ui).
{: tip}

1. Create a new filter.
   ```bash
   ibmcloud catalog filter create [--catalog CATALOG] [--category CATEGORY] [--compliance COMPLIANCE] [--deployment-target TARGET] [--exclude-list LIST] [--include-all ALL] [--include-list LIST] [--offering-format FORMAT] [--pricing-plan PLAN] [--provider PROVIDER] [--release RELEASE] [--type TYPE]
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   When the `--catalog CATALOG` command is not specified, the filter is created at the account level.

1. Target an account group by specifying the command option `--account-group ACCOUNT GROUP`.
1. Update the filter to include or exclude a particular product or products. See the [Catalog management CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-catalogs-plugin#create-filter) guidance for command options or run the `ibmcloud catalog filter options` command to retrieve the filter options for each filter category.

## Managing access to products for specific users by using the CLI
{: #set-private-filters-cli}
{: cli}

Set filters at a private catalog level for fine-grained control of which products in the public catalog are available only to the users you choose.
1. Create a new filter.
   ```bash
   ibmcloud catalog filter create [--catalog CATALOG] [--category CATEGORY] [--compliance COMPLIANCE] [--deployment-target TARGET] [--exclude-list LIST] [--include-all ALL] [--include-list LIST] [--offering-format FORMAT] [--pricing-plan PLAN] [--provider PROVIDER] [--release RELEASE] [--type TYPE]
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Make sure to specify the `--catalog CATALOG` command option. When `--catalog CATALOG` is not specified, the filter is created at the account level.

1. Target an account group by specifying the command option `--account-group ACCOUNT GROUP`.
1. Update the filter to include or exclude a particular product or products. See the [Catalog management CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-catalogs-plugin#create-filter) guidance for command options or run the `ibmcloud catalog filter options` command to retrieve the filter options for each filter category.

## Updating the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog by using the API
{: #set-public-visibility-api}
{: api}

Users in your account have access to all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public catalog by default. You can make products available only to the users you choose by turning off visibility to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog and adding the products to your private catalogs.

This setting also controls visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} module registry and community registry. For more information, see [Open source offerings](/docs/overview?topic=overview-whatis-platform#solutions-open-source).

Use the following command to turn off visibility of the public catalog to all users in your account.

```bash
curl -X "PUT" "https://cm.globalcatalog.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1-beta/catalogaccount"
-H "accept: */*"
-H "Authorization: {iam-bearer-token}"
-d '{"id":"string","hide_IBM_cloud_catalog":true,"account_filters":{"include_all":true,"category_filters":{"additionalProp1":{"include":true,"filter":{"filter_terms":["string"]}},"additionalProp2":{"include":true,"filter":{"filter_terms":["string"]}},"additionalProp3":{"include":true,"filter":{"filter_terms":["string"]}}},"id_filters":{"include":{"filter_terms":["string"]},"exclude":{"filter_terms":["string"]}}}}'
```
{: codeblock}

Make sure the `hide_IBM_cloud_catalog` field has a Boolean value of `true` to hide the public catalog in this account. Alternatively, you can give the `include_all` field a Boolean value of `false` for each `account_filters` object to exclude all of the public catalog.
See the [Catalog Management API](/apidocs/resource-catalog/private-catalog?code=curl#update-catalog-account){: external} for more information.

## Managing access to products for all users by using the API
{: #set-account-filters-api}
{: api}

You can use filters to manage which products in the public catalog are available to all users in your account. For example, you might want to restrict access to third-party products. Or, you might want users to work with a specific software type.
If your account is a parent account in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enterprise, the filters that you set apply to all child account groups and accounts. For more information, see [Customizing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog for an enterprise](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-catalog-enterprise-restrict&interface=ui).

```
{: codeblock}

The options for `{accountFilters}` are: `include_all`, `category_filters`, and `id_filters`.
See the [Catalog Management API](/apidocs/resource-catalog/private-catalog?code=curl#update-catalog-account){: external} for more information.

## Managing access to products for specific users by using the API
{: #set-private-filters-api}
{: api}

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
'https://cm.globalcatalog.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1-beta/catalogs/<catalog-id>'
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -H "Authorization: ${IC_IAM_TOKEN}" \
 -d '{"label": "testcurlcatalog4", "short_description": "testing creating a catalog through curl", "catalog_filters": { "include_all": false, "id_filters": { "include": { "filter_terms": [ "AdvancedMobileAccess-d6aece47-d840-45b0-8ab9-ad15354deeea" ] } } }}'

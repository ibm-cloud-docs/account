# Viewing your invoices
{: #managing-invoices}

To manage and view your invoices, visit the [Invoices](https://cloud.ibm.com/billing/invoices){: external} page from the billing and usage dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console. If your account is billed through a separate billing platform, you can see the following message on the Invoices page:

This page reflects only classic infrastructure charges. To view your official invoice and for any pricing inquiries, visit IBM Invoices. To sign up and view your invoices, you must provide your IBM customer number. If you don't know your customer number, contact IBM Cloud Support by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option.
{: note}

In these situations, visit the [Invoices@IBM](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/invoices/welcome){: external} website to see your invoices.

## Before you begin
{: #setting-prereqs}

To view your invoices, you need to be assigned the operator role or higher on the billing account management service. For more information, see [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services).

## Viewing invoices for new US-based Pay-As-You-Go accounts with credit card billing
{: #viewing-invoices-tob}

New {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go accounts for US customers with credit card billing can now view all classic infrastructure and platform services on one invoice. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**.

The new invoice hierarchy highlights the most important details. By showcasing when the usage is measured, you can view each invoiceâ€™s billing period in a clarified and comprehensive manner. The adjustments section on your invoice provides details about credits and adjustments from previous billing periods that might be included on an invoice from a different month.

The charges on your invoice are consistent with the usage dashboard. On the Invoices page in the console, click **View usage** to be directed to your usage dashboard. From there, you can select a timeframe and view billing and usage information that aligns directly with the details in your invoice.

### Checking your invoice status
{: #status-invoices}

You can check the status of your invoice on the [Invoices page](/billing/invoices):

* **Invoiced**: You received the latest invoice from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
* **Paid**: Your payment for the charges on your latest invoice was received.
* **Unpaid**: The charges on your latest invoice have not been paid.
* **Pending**: Your payment for your latest charges has not been applied due to a payment processing error. In this case, you can contact {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support for more details about the error.

Turning a resource "off" doesn't cancel the resource in your account. To cancel the resource, you must cancel the plan for the server.
{: note}

You will receive invoices for resources in your account until you cancel them. See [Cancelling your billing items](/docs/account?topic=account-cancel-billing-items) for more information.

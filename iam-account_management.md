# Assigning access to account management services
{: #account-services}

As the account owner or the administrator of an account management service, you can grant users access to invite users to the account, track billing and usage, and work with support cases. Users with account management access policies can also manage service IDs, access policies, catalog entries, access groups, resources for the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service, and work with Context-based restrictions.
{: shortdesc}

<!--- UI --->

## Assigning access in the console
{: #console-acct-mgmt}
{: ui}

To assign access to one or all account management services, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, click **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**, and then select **Users**.
1. Click the user that you want to assign access, then go to **Access** > **Assign access**.
1. For the service, select **All Account Management services** or select a specific account management service. Then, click **Next**.
1. Scope the access to **All resources** or **Specific resources**. Then, click **Next**.
1. Select any combination of roles or permissions, and click **Review**.
1. Click **Add** to add your policy configuration to your policy summary.
1. Click **Assign**.

To grant another user full access to the account for the purposes of managing user access and all IAM-enabled account resources, you must assign two policies. To create the first policy, select **All Identity and Access enabled services** with the Administrator platform role and Manager service role. To create the second policy, select **All Account Management services** with the Administrator role assigned.

Users with the Administrator role for account management services can change the access of other users and remove users from the account, including other users with the administrator role.

### Support center
{: #support-center-account-management}

You can give users access to manage support cases.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Viewer        |  View cases   \n  \n Search cases                                             |
| Operator      |  Not applicable                                                               |
| Editor        |  View cases   \n  \n Search cases   \n  \n Update cases   \n  \n Create cases |
| Administrator |  View cases   \n  \n Search cases   \n  \n Update cases   \n  \n Create cases |
{: caption="Table 18. Roles and example actions for the Support Center service" caption-side="top"}

Assign users the viewer role on the user management service in addition to a support center access policy so the user can see all cases in the account regardless of user list visibility settings. If the user list visibility is set to be restricted, this can limit a user's ability to view, search, and manage support cases in an account that they didn't open themselves.
{: tip}

### User management
{: #user-management-account-management}

You can give users access to view users in an account, invite and remove users, and view and update user profile settings.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Viewer        | View users in the account   \n  \n View user profile settings                                          |
| Operator      | View users in the account   \n  \n View user profile settings                                          |
| Editor        | View, invite, remove, and update users from the account   \n  \n View and update user profile settings |
| Administrator | View, invite, remove, and update users from the account   \n  \n View and update user profile settings |
{: caption="Table 19. Roles and example actions for the User Management service" caption-side="top"}

The viewer role on the user management service is a role that is commonly assigned for users assigned a role to view or manage support cases. If an account owner restricts the visibility of the user list in the IAM settings, users can't see support cases that are opened by other users in the account. However, if they are assigned the viewer role for the user management service, the user list visibility setting doesn't affect the ability to view cases in the account.

### {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing
{: #activty-tracker-account-management}

You can give users access to run platform actions.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                |

| Operator      | View {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} configuration resources such as routes and targets. |
| Editor        | View, create, update, and delete {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} resources. |
| Administrator | View, create, update, and delete {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} resources.   \n  \n Assign access policies to manage {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} resources to other users in the account. |

<!--- API --->

## Account management service names
{: #account-management-servicenames}
{: api}

If you are assigning access by using the CLI or API, the account management services use the following attributes and values:

| Account management service         | Attribute and value   |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| All Account Management services | `serviceType=platform_service` |
| All IAM Account Management services | `service_group_id=IAM` |

## Actions and roles for account management services
{: #account-management-actions-roles-api}
{: api}

The following tables outline the actions that users can take when they are assigned a specific role for each account management service. Review the information to ensure that you are assigning the correct level of access to your users.

### All Account Management services
{: #all-account-management-api}

To quickly give users a wide range of account management access, you can assign a policy on all account management services. When a user is assigned a role on **All Account Management services**, they can complete all of the actions that are associated with that role for each individual service.

The group of **All Account Management services** includes the following services:
- IAM Access Groups
- IAM Identity service
- IAM Access Management
   - Role management
- User Management
- Billing
- Catalog management
- Context-based restrictions
- Enterprise
- Global catalog
- IBM Cloud shell settings
- License and entitlement
- Partner Center
- Partner Center - Sell
- Security and Compliance Center
- Software instance
- Support center

| Roles         | Actions | role_ID value |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Viewer        | All viewer role actions for the account management services                                                  | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer` |
| Operator      | All operator role actions for the account management services  | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Operator` |
| Editor        | All editor role actions for the account management services and the ability to create resource groups        | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor` |
| Administrator | All administrator role actions for the account management services and the ability to create resource groups | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator` |
{: caption="Table 2. Roles and example actions for a policy on all account management services" caption-side="top"}

### All IAM Account Management services
{: #all-iam-api}

Identity and Access Management (IAM) services make up a subset of all account management services. Give users access to all IAM account management services so that they can work with the following services:

- IAM Access Groups
- IAM Identity service
- IAM Access Management
   - Role Management
- User Management

| Roles         | Actions | role_ID value |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Viewer        | All viewer role actions for IAM services | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer` |
| Operator      | All operator role actions for IAM services | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Operator` |
| Editor        | All editor role actions for IAM services and the ability to create resource groups        |  `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor` |
| Administrator | All administrator role actions for IAM services and the ability to create resource groups | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator` |
| User API key creator | Create API keys when the account setting to restrict API key creation is enabled | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::::serviceRole:UserApiKeyCreator` |
| Service ID creator | Create service IDs when the account setting to restrict service ID creation is enabled | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::::serviceRole:ServiceIdCreator`
{: caption="Table 3. Roles and example actions for a policy on all IAM account management services" caption-side="top"}

Some roles that you might assign on a policy for **All IAM Account Management services** affect only certain resources. For example, the role Service ID Creator is relevant to only the IAM Identity service.
{: note}

### Billing
{: #billing-acct-mgmt-api}

You can give users access to update account settings, view subscriptions, view offers, apply subscription and feature codes, update spending limits, and track usage by using the Billing service.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                    | role_ID value    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Viewer        | View account feature settings   \n  \n View subscriptions in account   \n  \n View account name   \n  \n View subscription balances and track usage | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer` |
| Operator      | View account feature settings   \n  \n View subscriptions in account   \n  \n View and change account name | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Operator` |
| Editor        | View and update account feature settings   \n  \n View subscriptions in account   \n  \n View offers in account   \n  \n View and apply subscription and feature codes   \n  \n View and change account name   \n  \n View and update spending limits   \n  \n Set spending notifications   \n  \n View subscription balances and track usage | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor` |
| Administrator | View and update account feature settings   \n  \n View subscriptions in account   \n  \n View offers in account   \n  \n View and apply subscription and feature codes   \n  \n View and change account name   \n  \n View and update spending limits   \n  \n Set spending notifications   \n  \n View subscription balances and track usage   \n  \n Create an enterprise | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator` |
{: caption="Table 4. Roles and example actions for the Billing service" caption-side="top"}

It's possible to view subscription balances and usage from the Account settings page, but you can't view the Account settings page with the Viewer or Operator roles. To access the Account settings page and your subscription information from that page, you need the Editor role or higher.
{: note}

### Catalog management
{: #catalog-management-account-management-api}

You can give users access to view private catalogs and catalog filters, create private catalogs, add software to private catalogs, and set catalog filters.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                | role_ID value    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Viewer        | View account-level filters set for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog   \n  \n View private catalogs | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer` |
| Operator      | Create private catalogs   \n  \n Set filters for private catalogs   \n  \n Add and update software   \n  \n View account-level filters | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Operator` |
| Editor        | Create private catalogs   \n  \n Set filters for private catalogs   \n  \n Add and update software   \n  \n View account-level filters | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor` |
| Administrator | Set account-level filters for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog   \n  \n Create, update, and delete private catalogs   \n  \n Publish {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-approved products   \n  \n Assign access policies | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator` |
| Publisher     | Publish products that are approved by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} from a private catalog | `crn:v1:bluemix:public:globalcatalog-collection::::serviceRole:Promoter`
{: caption="Table 5. Roles and example actions for the catalog management service" caption-side="top"}

### Context-based restrictions
{: #cbr-account-management-api}

You can give users access to view, create, update, and remove network zones. To create a context-based restriction rule for a service, you must be assigned an IAM policy with the Administrator role the service you are creating a rule against. For example, if you want to create a rule to protect a **Key Protect** instance, you must be assigned the Administrator role on the **Key Protect** service and the Viewer role or higher on the **Context-based restrictions** service.

The Viewer role on the Context-based restrictions service allows you to add network zones to your rule.

The viewer role on the user management service is a role that is commonly assigned for users assigned a role to view or manage support cases. If an account owner restricts the visibility of the user list in the IAM settings, users can't see support cases that are opened by other users in the account. However, if they are assigned the viewer role for the user management service, the user list visibility setting doesn't affect the ability to view cases in the account.

## Account management service names
{: #account-management-servicenames-cli}
{: cli}

If you are assigning access by using the CLI or API, the account management services use the following attributes and values:

| Account management service         | Attribute and value   |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| All Account Management services | `serviceType=platform_service` |
| All IAM Account Management services | `service_group_id=IAM` |
| Billing | `serviceName=billing` |
| Catalog management | `serviceName=globalcatalog-collection` |
| Context-based restrictions | `serviceName=context-based-restrictions`|
| Enterprise | `serviceName=enterprise` |
| Global catalog | `serviceName=globalcatalog` |
| IAM Access Groups service | `serviceName=iam-groups` |
| IAM Identity service | `serviceName=iam-identity` |
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_notm}} | `serviceName=cloudshell` |
| License and entitlement | `serviceName=entitlement` |
| Role management | `serviceName=iam-access-management` |
| {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} | `serviceName=security-compliance` |
| Support center| `serviceName=support` |
| User management | `serviceName=user-management` |
{: caption="Table 1. Account management service names" caption-side="top"}

## Assigning access by using the CLI
{: #cli-acct-mgmt}
{: cli}

To assign access, run the `user-policy-create` command. For more information, see [ibmcloud iam user-policy-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_user_policy_create). The following example command assigns a policy with the User API key creator role for the IAM Identity account management service.

```sh
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create name@example.com --roles "User API key creator" --service-name iam-identity
```
{: pre}

For service names to use in the CLI command for each account management service, see Table 1. However, for a policy on all account management services in the CLI, use `--account-management` instead of `--service-name SERVICE_NAME`. For roles that are more than one word, use the display name with quotations.
{: tip}

The following example command assigns a policy with the Administrator role for All Account Management services.

```sh
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create name.example.com --roles Administrator --attributes serviceType=service
```
{: pre}

## Actions and roles for account management services
{: #account-management-actions-roles-cli}
{: cli}

The following tables outline the actions that users can take when they are assigned a specific role for each account management service. Review the information to ensure that you are assigning the correct level of access to your users.

### All Account Management services

### Context-based restrictions
{: #cbr-account-management-cli}

You can give users access to view, create, update, and remove network zones. To create a context-based restriction rule for a service, you must be assigned an IAM policy with the Administrator role the service you are creating a rule against. For example, if you want to create a rule to protect a **Key Protect** instance, you must be assigned the Administrator role on the **Key Protect** service and the Viewer role or higher on the  **Context-based restrictions** service.

The Viewer role on the Context-based restrictions service allows you to add network zones to your rule.
{: note}

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                |

{: caption="Table 18. Roles and example actions for the Software instance service" caption-side="top"}

### Support center
{: #support-center-account-management-cli}

You can give users access to manage support cases.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Viewer        |  View cases   \n  \n Search cases                                             |
| Operator      |  Not applicable                                                               |
| Editor        |  View cases   \n  \n Search cases   \n  \n Update cases   \n  \n Create cases |
| Administrator |  View cases   \n  \n Search cases   \n  \n Update cases   \n  \n Create cases |
{: caption="Table 19. Roles and example actions for the Support Center service" caption-side="top"}

Assign users the viewer role on the user management service in addition to a support center access policy so the user can see all cases in the account regardless of user list visibility settings. If the user list visibility is set to be restricted, this can limit a user's ability to view, search, and manage support cases in an account that they didn't open themselves.
{: tip}

### User management
{: #user-management-account-management-cli}

You can give users access to view users in an account, invite and remove users, and view and update user profile settings.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Viewer        | View users in the account   \n  \n View user profile settings                                          |
| Operator      | View users in the account   \n  \n View user profile settings                                          |
| Editor        | View, invite, remove, and update users from the account   \n  \n View and update user profile settings |
| Administrator | View, invite, remove, and update users from the account   \n  \n View and update user profile settings |
{: caption="Table 20. Roles and example actions for the User Management service" caption-side="top"}

The viewer role on the user management service is a role that is commonly assigned for users assigned a role to view or manage support cases. If an account owner restricts the visibility of the user list in the IAM settings, users can't see support cases that are opened by other users in the account. However, if they are assigned the viewer role for the user management service, the user list visibility setting doesn't affect the ability to view cases in the account.

### {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing
{: #activty-tracker-account-management-cli}

You can give users access to run platform actions.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                |

<!--- Terraform --->

## Assigning access by using Terraform
{: #terraform-acct-mgmt}
{: terraform}

Before you can assign access by using Terraform, make sure that you have completed the following:

- Install the Terraform CLI and configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform. For more information, see the tutorial for [Getting started with Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started). The plug-in abstracts the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} APIs that are used to complete this task.
- Create a Terraform configuration file that is named `main.tf`. In this file, you define resources by using HashiCorp Configuration Language. For more information, see the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/index.html){: external}.

Use the following steps to assign access by using Terraform:

1. Create an argument in your `main.tf` file. The following example assigns a policy with the `Viewer` role on the IAM Access groups account management service.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_iam_access_group" "accgrp" {
    name = "test"
   }

   resource "ibm_iam_access_group_policy" "policy" {
    access_group_id = ibm_iam_access_group.accgrp.id
    roles           = ["Viewer"]
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   You can specify the ID of the access group on the `access_group_id` option. For more information, see the argument reference details on the [Terraform Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/iam_access_group_policy){: external} page.

1. After you finish building your configuration file, initialize the Terraform CLI. For more information, see [Initializing Working Directories](https://www.terraform.io/cli/init){: external}.

   ```terraform
   terraform init
   ```
   {: pre}

1. Provision the resources from the `main.tf` file. For more information, see [Provisioning Infrastructure with Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/cli/run){: external}.

   1. Run `terraform plan` to generate a Terraform execution plan to preview the proposed actions.

      ```terraform
      terraform plan
      ```
      {: pre}

   1. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources that are defined in the plan.

      ```terraform
      terraform apply
      ```
      {: pre}

## Actions and roles for account management services
{: #account-management-actions-roles-terra}
{: terraform}

The following tables outline the actions that users can take when they are assigned a specific role for each account management service. Review the information to ensure that you are assigning the correct level of access to your users.

### All Account Management services
{: #all-account-management-terra}

To quickly give users a wide-ranging set of account management access, you can assign a policy on all account management services. When a user is assigned a role on **All Account Management services**, they can complete all of the actions that are associated with that role for each individual service.

The group of **All Account Management services** includes the following services:
- IAM Access Groups
- IAM Identity service
- IAM Access Management
   - Role management
- User Management
- Billing
- Catalog management
- Context-based restrictions
- Enterprise
- Global catalog
- IBM Cloud shell settings
- License and entitlement

| Administrator | All administrator role actions for the account management services and the ability to create resource groups |
{: caption="Table 1. Roles and example actions for a policy on account management services" caption-side="top"}

### All IAM Account Management services
{: #all-iam-terra}

Identity and Access Management (IAM) services make up a subset of all account management services. Give users access to all IAM account management services so that they can work with the following services:

- IAM Access Groups
- IAM Identity service
- IAM Access Management
   - Role Management
- User Management

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Viewer        | All viewer role actions for IAM services                                                  |
| Operator      | All operator role actions for IAM services                                                |
| Editor        | All editor role actions for IAM services and the ability to create resource groups        |
| Administrator | All administrator role actions for IAM services and the ability to create resource groups |
| User API key creator | Create API keys when the account setting to restrict API key creation is enabled |
| Service ID creator | Create service IDs when the account setting to restrict service ID creation is enabled |
{: caption="Table 2. Roles and example actions for a policy on all IAM account management services" caption-side="top"}

Some roles that you might assign on a policy for **All IAM Account Management services** affect only certain resources. For example, the role Service ID Creator is relevant to only the IAM Identity service.
{: note}

### Billing
{: #billing-acct-mgmt-terra}

You can give users access to update account settings, view subscriptions, view offers, apply subscription and feature codes, update spending limits, and track usage by using the Billing service.

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Viewer        | View account feature settings   \n  \n View subscriptions in account   \n  \n View account name   \n  \n View subscription balances and track usage           |
| Operator      | View account feature settings   \n  \n View subscriptions in account   \n  \n View and change account name |
| Editor        | View and update account feature settings   \n  \n View subscriptions in account   \n  \n View offers in account   \n  \n View and apply subscription and feature codes   \n  \n View and change account name   \n  \n View and update spending limits   \n  \n Set spending notifications   \n  \n View subscription balances and track usage |

### Context-based restrictions
{: #cbr-account-management-terra}

You can give users access to view, create, update, and remove network zones. To create a context-based restriction rule for a service, you must be assigned an IAM policy with the Administrator role the service you are creating a rule against. For example, if you want to create a rule to protect a **Key Protect** instance, you must be assigned the Administrator role on the **Key Protect** service and the Viewer role or higher on the  **Context-based restrictions** service.

The Viewer role on the Context-based restrictions service allows you to add network zones to your rule.
{: note}

| Roles         | Actions                                                                                                |

Assign users the viewer role on the user management service in addition to a support center access policy so the user can see all cases in the account regardless of user list visibility settings. If the user list visibility is set to be restricted, this can limit a user's ability to view, search, and manage support cases in an account that they didn't open themselves.

{: caption="Table 19. Roles and example actions for the User Management service" caption-side="top"}

The viewer role on the user management service is a role that is commonly assigned for users assigned a role to view or manage support cases. If an account owner restricts the visibility of the user list in the IAM settings, users can't see support cases that are opened by other users in the account. However, if they are assigned the viewer role for the user management service, the user list visibility setting doesn't affect the ability to view cases in the account.

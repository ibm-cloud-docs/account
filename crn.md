# Cloud Resource Names
{: #crn}

A Cloud Resource Name (CRN) uniquely identifies {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} resources. A CRN is used to specify a resource in an unambiguous way that is guaranteed to be globally unique.
{: shortdesc}

A CRN is formed from a concatenation of "segments" that hierarchically identify the resource, its location, and the service it belongs to. The segment delimiter is set to a colon (`:`). All CRNs begin with the segment identifier `crn`.


## CRN format
{: #format-crn}

The base canonical format of a CRN is:

`crn:version:cname:ctype:service-name:location:scope:service-instance:resource-type:resource`


## version
{: #version-crn}

The `version` segment identifies the version of the CRN format. Currently, the only valid version segment value is `v1`.


## cname
{: #cname-crn}

The `cname` segment identifies the cloud instance and is an alphanumeric identifier that uniquely identifies the cloud instance that contains the resource. A `cname` effectively identifies an independent control plane that owns the identified resource. The value for the `cname` segment must be `bluemix` for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} users.


## ctype
{: #ctype-crn}

The `ctype` segment identifies the type of cloud instance that is represented by the specified `cname` segment.

 Valid values:
- `public`: All services that are available from the public catalog
- `dedicated`: Only for current {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dedicated environments
- `local`: All services that are deployed locally in your own environment


## service-name
{: #service-name-crn}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enforces global uniqueness of service names. The `service-name` segment identifies a capability (service, component, or product) that is offered by the cloud. The capability can be a user-provided service, such as with the services that are listed in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, or an internal architectural component critical to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} functionality.

The `service-name` segment indicates the service that the resource belongs to. The `service-name` segment must be alphanumeric, lowercase, and have no spaces or special characters other than `-`. If you're identifying a service name for a child service, you must have a period `.` that separates the parent service name from the child. For example, if you have a service that's called `iam-service` and a child of that is called `micro`, `iam-service` is the parent service and `iam-service.micro` is considered the child service.

For services that are registered into the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, the `service-name` segment must correspond to one of the services that are registered to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} global catalog service. It is the `name` property that is returned by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} global catalog service API `GET https://globalcatalog.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/{id}` for the corresponding resource instance or the `service-name` value that is displayed by the command-line interface (CLI): `ibmcloud service offerings` in the `service` column.


## location
{: #location-crn}

The cloud geography/region/zone/data center that the resource resides.

The `location` segment must be one of the location names listed by the [`ibmcloud catalog locations`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_catalog#ibmcloud_catalog_locations) CLI command.

Some resources do not require a region, as they can be considered global. In this case, the `region` segment is set to `global`.
{: tip}


## scope
{: #scope-crn}

The `scope` segment identifies the containment or owner of the resource. Some resources do not require an owner (they can be considered `global`). In this case, the `scope` segment is empty (a blank string).

The value of the `scope` segment must be formatted as `{scopePrefix}`/`{id}`. The `scopePrefix` represents the format that is used to identify the owner or containment. The `id` represents the identity of the owner or containment in a format that is specific to the `scopePrefix`.

| Scope Type   | Scope Prefix     | Usage                                                                                   | Example                                  |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Account      | a/`{account id}` | The account that the resource was created in.                                           | `a/292558`                               |
| Organization | o/`{org guid}`   | The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Organization to which the resource was assigned. | `o/4716e2d1-35b7-431f-891a-b552bf0b3c66` |
| Space        | s/`{space guid}` | The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Space to which the resource was assigned.        | `s/48b3cdcd-e804-4398-9032-73065863ad7c` |

## service-instance
{: #service-instance-crn}

The `service-instance` segment identifies the service instance uniquely. The format of the `service-instance` segment varies by service. Each service must document the format of their `service_instance` segment as part of their service metadata. Some services do not have instances because the instance is global, and in this case the `service-instance` field is blank.

The `service-instance` must be alphanumeric, lowercase, no spaces, or special characters other than '-' and '/'.

For example, a DevOps tool that is used to track and plan work items can have a simple `GUID` instance ID ("1234-5678-9012-3456"). But, the policy component of an autoscale group service can use a hierarchical naming convention and have a `service-id` segment of:

`c7a27f55-d35e-4153-b044-8ca9155fc467/my-test-asg1/my-scaleout-policy`

You can also obtain a CRN from an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resource by using the following CLI command:

```bash
ibmcloud resource service-instance
```
{: codeblock}

## resource-type, resource
{: #resource-type-crn}

The values of the `resource-type` and `resource` segments vary by service. A service is required to document their supported `resource types` segment and the format of the `resource` segment as part of their service metadata.

As an example, an image in the customer receipts container in an Object Storage service can have a `resource-type` segment of  `object` and a `resource` value of `CustomerReceipts/clientdinner.png`.

The `resource-type` segment must be alphanumeric, lowercase, and no spaces or special characters other than '-'. A service can decide that the `resource-type` segment is optional, in which case it remains blank.

The following table lists the string comparison operators that you can use to build access policies with `/v2/policies` syntax. For more information about each version, see [Comparing `/v1/policies` and `/v2/policies` syntax](/docs/account?topic=account-known-issues#compare-syntax). For example use cases of the operators, see [Resource attribute-based conditions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-condition-properties&interface=ui#resource-based-conditions).

* Table - **String comparisons** is used in the following files:
   * known-issues.md
   * iam-wildcard.md

| Operator   | Description  |
|------------|--------------|
| `stringEquals`  | Case-sensitive string comparison. Boolean or number values are converted into a string before comparison. |
| `stringMatch`  | Case-sensitive string match is performed between the pattern and the target string by using either an asterisk (`*`), question mark (`?`), both, or none (same as literal value). An asterisk (`*`) represents any sequence of zero or more characters in the string, and a question mark (`?`) represents any single character. You can also express an asterisk `*` and question mark `?` as a literal value by enclosing each within two sets of curly brackets `{{}}`. |
| `stringExists`  |  Boolean where `true` indicates that the string must be present and can be empty. `false` indicates that the string must not be present. |
| `stringEqualsAnyOf` | Case-sensitive exact string matching any of the strings in an array of strings. Limit of 10 values. |
| `stringMatchAnyOf` | Case-sensitive string matching any of the strings in an array of strings. The string values can include either an asterisk (`*`), question mark (`?`), both, or none (same as literal value). An asterisk (`*`) represents any sequence of zero or more characters in the string, and a question mark (`?`) represents any single character. You can also express an asterisk `*` and question mark `?` as a literal value by enclosing each within two sets of curly brackets `{{}}`. Limit of 10 values. |

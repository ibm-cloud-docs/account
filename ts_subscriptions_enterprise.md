{: troubleshoot}

When you go to view the Subscriptions page from a child account, the following message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

`Looks like you don't have permission to view subscription data for this account. Contact your account owner or administrator to request access.`

The following message is displayed in the Billing section on your enterprise dashboard:

`Looks like you don't have permission to view this information. Learn more about IAM access.`

Access to billing and payment information for future billing periods is restricted to users in the enterprise account. Users in a child account can't access billing and payment information, such as subscriptions, even if they previously had access in the account.
{: tsCauses}

To view or manage billing, you need to be invited to the enterprise account and given access to the Billing service in that account. Contact the account owner to request access.

{: #contactsupport-faq}
{: faq}

From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console menu bar, click the **Help** icon ![Help icon](../icons/help.svg "Help") > **Support center**.

Users with Lite or Trial accounts can view the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} documentation](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar), chat with the Virtual Cloud Assistant, use the [IBM Cloud Community](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/my-community), and use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud){: external}.


## How do I escalate support cases?
{: #escalate_support}

As an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} customer, you can escalate support cases to surface critical issues.

Provide your existing case number, the business impact of your issue, and a request to escalate the case.

If you have a Basic support plan, access to support is through cases only. If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider [upgrading to a Premium or Advanced support plan](/docs/account?topic=account-get-supportfaq#support-plan).

## How am I charged for support?
{: #support-costs}
{: faq}

If you have Advanced or Premium support, you can track your monthly support costs. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Support costs**. Each support plan has a minimum monthly support price for your cloud workload at the stated service level. Beyond this starting price, any additional costs for support are based on your resource usage. The higher your resource usage, the higher your total support cost.

Charges for support of third-party services are not included in the Advanced or Premium support charge calculations. These non-IBM programs are licensed directly by their providers.

To view your support costs, you need an access policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service. For more information about access roles, see [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).


## How can I upgrade my support plan?

{: faq}

If you want to upgrade your support plan, contact a [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} representative.

{: faq}

To access your support cases, from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console menu bar, click the **Help** icon ![Help icon](../icons/help.svg "Help") > **Support center**, and click **Manage cases**. If you're unable to view your cases, try clicking **View classic infrastructure cases**.

# Why can't I view all the resources on dashboard that was shared?
{: #ts_dash-access}
{: troubleshoot}

Your view of the scoped dashboard that was shared with you is different than the view for other users on the account. 
{: tsSymptoms}

You don't have the required IAM access on the individual resource. 
{: tsCauses}

The account owner can update your access on any resource in the account, or you can contact any user who is assigned the administrator role on the service or service instance. For more information, see [IAM access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).

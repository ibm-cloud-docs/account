# FAQs about accounts
{: #accountfaqs}

FAQs for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account might include questions about upgrading an account, reassigning users, resolving account errors, or tagging resources in an account. To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see our [FAQ library](/docs/faqs).
{: shortdesc}

## How do I create an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account?
{: #create-account}
{: faq}

You can create an account by [registering](/registration){: external} your email address. For identity verification, a credit card is required when you create a new account. New accounts are created as Pay-As-You-Go accounts, except purchased subscriptions. For more information, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).

Feature codes aren't supported in some countries. For more information, see [personal use availability](/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#signup-personalaccts).
{: note}

## Why is my credit card not authorized when I am creating an account?
{: #authorize-account}
{: faq}

A credit card is required to create a new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account unless you have a subscription or feature code. In many cases, a credit card isn't accepted because your credit card issuer didn't authorize it. You might see a temporary hold on your credit card for verification and security when creating an account. This credit card hold is reversed within 24 to 72 hours. For more information about issues with credit card authorization, see [Credit Card error messages](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cc-error-messages).


## How do I get help with issues with creating an account?
{: #account-error}
{: faq}

## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}
{: faq}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#liteaccount).

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}
{: faq}

There's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.

If you created a Lite account before 12 August 2021, you can build and deploy apps with 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.


## What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
{: faq}

Reaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.

You can check your usage by going to **Manage** > **Billing and usage** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and selecting **Usage**. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage).

## What are tags?
{: #know-about-tags}
{: faq}
{: support}

Tags are `key:value` pairs that you use to organize your resources and service IDs or control access to them.

* You can use user tags to organize and view resources and service IDs across your account and help you track usage costs.
* You can limit access to specific resources and service IDs in your account by using access management tags.

For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).

## What access is required to create access management tags?
{: #permissions-create-access-tags}
{: faq}

You must be the account owner or have the following roles:

* Administrator on all account management services
* Administrator on the tagging service

For more information, see [Granting users access to tag resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access).

## What access is required to attach or detach tags?
{: #permissions-add-remove-resource-tags}
{: faq}

* To manage user tags on a resource, you must have at least the editor role for IAM-enabled resources.
* To manage user tags on a service ID, you must have at least the editor role on the IAM Identity service.
* To manage access management tags, you must have the administrator role on the targeted resource.
* To manage access management tags on service IDs, you must have the administrator role on the IAM Identity service.

For more information, see [Granting users access to tag resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access).

## Can users in my account view my tags?
{: #tags-visibility-account}
{: faq}

Yes, tags are visible throughout your account. If your account users have permission to view a resource, they can also view all tags that are attached to those resources. For more information, see [Granting users access to tag resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access).

## Can I delete my tags?
{: #delete-tag}
{: faq}

Before you can delete a tag, you must detach it from all resources. The tag might be attached to a resource that you don't have permission to view. The same tag can be attached to several resources by different users in the same billing account. Users don't have the same visibility on all resources on the account. Contact the account owner who can resolve the problem by detaching the tag from the blocking resource.

If you still can't delete it, the tag might be attached to a reclaimed resource. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI to manage the reclamation process of specific resources. For more information, see [Using resource reclamations](/docs/account?topic=account-resource-reclamation).

When you delete an access management tag from the account, any associated IAM policies are also deleted with it.

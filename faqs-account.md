## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}
{: faq}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts). 

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}
{: faq}

In a Lite account, your apps have up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you use the available Lite account allowance. If you need more memory, upgrade to a billable account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use over that limit. There's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.

## What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
{: faq}
{: support}

Reaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org; not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.

You can check your usage by going to **Manage** > **Billing and usage** in the console, and selecting **Usage**. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage).

## How many resource groups, orgs, or spaces can I create?
{: #resourcelimit}
{: faq}
{: support}

If you have a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, there's no limit to the number of resource groups, orgs, or spaces that you can create. However, if you have a Lite account, you're limited to one org and one resource group.

## Can I view a list of accounts that I own?
{: #accounts-owned}
{: faq}

If you only see your name that is listed and you are not the account owner, the account owner has restricted the user list.

## What are tags?
{: #know-about-tags}
{: faq}

Tags are `key:value` pairs that you use to organize your resources or control access to them.

* You can use user tags to organize and view resources across your account and help you track usage costs.
* You can limit access to specific resources in your account by using access management tags. 

For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).

## What access is required to create access management tags?
{: #permissions-create-access-tags}
{: faq}

You must be the account owner or have the following roles:

* Administrator on all account management services
* Administrator on the tagging service

For more information, see [Granting users access to tag resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access).

## What access is required to attach or detach tags?
{: #permissions-add-remove-resource-tags}
{: faq}

* To manage user tags on a resource, you must have at least the editor role for IAM-enabled resources or the developer role in a Cloud Foundry space. 
* To manage access management tags, you must have the administrator role on the targeted resource.

For more information, see [Granting users access to tag resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access).

## Can users in my account view my tags?
{: #tags-visibility-account}
{: faq}

Yes, tags are visible throughout your account. If your account users have permission to view a resource, they can also view all tags that are attached to those resources. For more information, see [Granting users access to tag resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access).

## Can I delete my tags?
{: #delete-tag}
{: faq}

Before you can delete a tag, you must detach it from all resources. The tag might be attached to a resource that you don't have permission to view. The same tag can be attached to several resources by different users in the same billing account. Users don't have the same visibility on all resources on the account. Contact the account owner who can resolve the problem by detaching the tag from the blocking resource.

If you still can't delete it, the tag might be attached to a reclaimed resource. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI to manage the reclamation process of specific resources. For more information, see [Using resource reclamations](/docs/account?topic=account-resource-reclamation).

When you delete an access management tag from the account, any associated IAM policies are also deleted with it.
{: note}

## How do I view my dashboard role? 
{: #view-dashboard}
{: faq}

You can view the role that you are assigned on a dashboard by going to **Manage** > **Account** > **Dashboards**. All users besides the dashboard owner have the viewer role on the dashboard. 

## Can I edit the default dashboard?
{: #access-dashboard}
{: faq}

You can't edit the default dashboard directly. However, you can create a duplicate version of it that you can edit and personalize however you want by clicking the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Edit** in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. 

By maintaining the original version of the default dashboard, you can discover the latest widgets and functionalities, which get built and added over time. This way, you can always bring out the most of your workflow.

## What is Cloud Foundry?
{: #cloud-foundry}
{: faq}

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform as a service (PaaS) option available through {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public for building and deploying applications on the cloud. Cloud Foundry organizations and spaces are used to organize resources and apps available within specific regions.

For more information about managing orgs and spaces, see [Adding orgs and spaces](/docs/account?topic=account-orgsspacesusers).

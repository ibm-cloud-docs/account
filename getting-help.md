# Getting help and support
{: #gettinghelp}

If you experience an issue or have questions when you're working in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, you can use the following resources before you open a support case.
{: shortdesc}

* Review the [FAQs](/docs?tab=faqs&tags=get-support%2Cbilling-usage%2Caccount%2Csell) in the product documentation.
* Review the troubleshooting documentation for [accounts](/docs/account?topic=account-ts_logintoibm), [billing](/docs/account?topic=account-cannot-access-billing-info), [selling on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/sell?topic=sell-repo-upload-error), and [using the Support Center](/docs/account?topic=account-ts_tech-support-case) to troubleshoot and resolve common issues.
* Check the status of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and resources by going to the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external}.
* Review [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud){: external} to see whether other users experienced the same problem. When you ask a question, tag the question with `ibm-cloud`, so that it's seen by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} development teams.

 If you have paid support plans, for example Advanced or Premium plans, go to the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **Create a case** from the Contact Support section. After your support case is created, you can follow its progress on the [Manage cases](/unifiedsupport/cases/manage){: external} page. For more information about creating a case, see [Creating support cases](/docs/account?topic=account-open-case).

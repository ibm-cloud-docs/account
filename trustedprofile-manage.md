# Managing trusted profiles
{: #trusted-profile-update}

Manage trusted profiles by updating the permissions or redefining trust relationships at any time. You can also remove trusted profiles, so compute resources and federated users are unlinked from the profile and can no longer apply the trusted profile identity.
{: shortdesc}

When you remove trusted profiles, you revoke all active sessions. Users are immediately logged out and the removed profiles are no longer available to connect to the target account. API calls that use access tokens might be successful until the access token expires.

You can use {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} to monitor which federated users and compute resources apply a trusted profile. For more information, see [Monitoring login sessions for trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-trusted-profile-monitor).
{: tip}

## Before you begin
{: #prereqs-manage-tp}

* You must be assigned the administrator, operator, or editor role within the account, or on the IAM Identity Service to manage trusted profiles.

## Updating trusted profiles by using the console
{: #updating-tp-console}
{: ui}

To update trusted profiles, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and select **Trusted profiles**. Then, select the name of the trusted profile that you want to update.

### Updating the description of your profile
{: #description}

Click the name of the trusted profile that you want to update, and select **Actions** > **Edit**. Enter the new name and description, and click **Apply**.

### Redefining the trust relationship
{: #trust}

After the trusted profile is created, you can build trust with both federated users and compute resources in the same trusted profile.

1. Click the name of the trusted profile that you want to update.
2. Click **Add** to add a condition to the existing trust relationship. To edit an existing condition, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Edit** next to the trust relationship you want to update.
   * Click **Add a condition** and repeat as needed to add more conditions.
   * To remove a condition, click the **Remove** icon ![Remove icon](../icons/close-icon.svg "Remove") next to the existing condition.
3. Click **Save** to apply all added or removed conditions to your trusted profile.

### Assigning access
{: #update-tp-access}

You can assign access to a trusted profile by assigning individual access policies, or by adding the trusted profiles to an existing access group.

#### Assigning access policies
{: #update-tp-policy}

1. Click the name of the trusted profile that you want to update.
2. Click **Access**.
3. To edit existing access policies, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Edit** next to the access policy you want to update.

## Updating trusted profiles by using the CLI
{: #updating-tp-cli}
{: cli}

You can update a trusted profile from your account by using the CLI. For more information, see the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-cloud-cli-release/releases).

1. Log in, and select the account.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud login
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Check the list of trusted profiles for the current account and select the one that you want to update. The following command shows the list of trusted profiles for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam trusted-profiles
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. If you'd like to check the details of a trusted profile, use the `ibmcloud iam trusted-profile` command. Specify the ID or the name of the trusted profile that you would like to check.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam trusted-profile <IDorName>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Run the following command to get an overview about the different options.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam trusted-profile-update
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Update the trusted profile by running the following command. Specify the ID or the name of the trusted profile that you would like to update and rename.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam trusted-profile-update <IDorName> -n <NewName> ...
   ```
   {: codeblock}

For example, the following command updates the name `Test trusted profile` to `New test trusted profile`.

   ```bash
   ibmcloud iam trusted-profile-update <Test trusted profile> -n <New test trusted profile> ...
   ```
   {: codeblock}

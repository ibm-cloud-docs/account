# Using services with classic infrastructure assets
{: #api-services-infrastructure}

You can easily use API-based public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} services with your classic infrastructure assets. All APIs are secure and encrypted so that your data is protected.

You can gain insights and cognitive knowledge by calling Watson APIs from your apps to make them more personalized. Or, use data and analytics services to tap into high-performance analytics for your apps. Or, choose database-as-a-service where you can leave the management to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Modernize your application development by using containers with services like {{site.data.keyword.activedeployshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}. You can then use the {{site.data.keyword.vpn_short}} service to communicate and connect your container in a private network to the classic infrastructure private network. All of the usage charges of the compute resources and services are reflected in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} invoice.

For example, do you want to add cognitive capabilities from Watson to your apps that are running on classic infrastructure bare metal servers? You can add a service such as {{site.data.keyword.personalityinsightsshort}} to help understand your app's user by completing the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, search for the service in the catalog.
2. Create an instance of the service with just a few clicks.
3. Set up the service to run with your existing code by copying the service credentials and adding them to your application.
4. After the update to the app, deploy the new version to your classic infrastructure assets.

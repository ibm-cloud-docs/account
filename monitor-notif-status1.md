# Monitoring notifications and status
{: #viewing-cloud-status}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [Status page](/status){: external} is the central place to find details about major incidents that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} platform and services. Other incidents, planned maintenance, announcements, release notes, and security bulletins are posted on the Notifications page, where you can easily view them.
{: shortdesc}

To get notified about key events that are specifically affecting your account, go to the [Notifications page](/notifications){: external}. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Notifications page is a centralized place to view and control all incidents, maintenance, announcements, and security bulletins. Events that are displayed on the Notifications page are ones that specifically impact users based on the preferences that the account owner or administrator sets. You can also view events from the past year that are now completed on the [History page](/status/history){: external}.

Pages specific to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} classic infrastructure are deprecated. The Notifications page hosts all classic infrastructure notifications. You can view classic infrastructure history for planned and unplanned incidents and announcements on the Notifications page.

## Viewing status
{: #view-status-page}

To view the Status page, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, click the **Notifications** icon ![Notifications icon "Notifications"](../icons/Notification.svg) in the menu bar.
1. Click **View cloud status**.
1. From the side navigation pane, you can select to view planned maintenance, security bulletins, announcements, release notes, and history.

   To view planned maintenance and report outages for your account, you must be logged in to your authorized account.
   {: note}

   * Click **Planned maintenance** to see any upcoming scheduled maintenance.
   * Click **Security bulletins** to view a list of security bulletins that might affect various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services or the platform.
   * Click **Announcements** to view a list of announcements that might be of general interest to you.
   * Click **Release notes** to view release entries for the last year.
   * Click **History** to view a list of completed events from the past year.

   If any issue occurs with the Status page, contact [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.
   {: note}

1. You can filter the lists by selecting specific components, locations, dates, types of ongoing events, or by using keyword searches. Click each item to get more details about the changes and why, and how they impact your environment.

## Advanced status search
{: #adv-search}

You can build URL search values by using query parameters from outside the console.

The following list includes examples of URL search options:

* Load the page with the Status tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status`
* Load the page with the Planned maintenance tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=maintenance`
* Load the page with the Security bulletin tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=security`
* Load the page with the Announcements tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=announcement`
* Load the page with a search query entered: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=<selected>&query=<query>`
* Land on the page with filters selected. For example, you can set the geographic location to North America by using the following URL search: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status&region=na`

* Use unique notification identifiers as a search parameter to go directly to the details for the notification. For example, `query=INC1000001` targets items with the ID: `INC1000001`. In this example, `INC1000001` is the case number for a maintenance notification.

### URL query filters:
{: #url-query}

The following table provides information on URL query filters that you can use to search across all tabs on the status page.

| URL Query Parameter | Description                                                                                                                         | Values                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `?type`             | A filter that applies only to the Status tab. Use the `?type` query to filter the Status tab by incidents or maintenance.           | `=incident`, `=maintenance` |
| `?region`           | Filter the page by geographic location.                                                                                             | `=na`, `=eu`, `=sa`, `=ap`  |
| `?component`        | Filter the page by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} components. For example, you might filter by a service you are interested in. | Applies to most global catalog IDs; for example, `?component=iotf-service` filters the page and display events that affect Internet of Things Platform |
{: caption="URL query filters" caption-side="top"}

You can always use the **Filter by** filters, and then copy or bookmark the URL query that is generated. The filters are displayed in your URL and can help you build future queries.

## Getting advanced notice for disruptive maintenance
{: #disruptive-maintenance}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tries to limit disruptive, required maintenance for Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Software as a Service offerings. Most maintenance is done in a nondisruptive manner to avoid the impact to your business, but when disruptive maintenance is necessary, we provide as much advanced notice as possible.

### Iaas
{: #iaas}

For IaaS offerings, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides advanced notice that's dependent on the severity of the impact. The following table defines the types and levels of the possibility of an impact.

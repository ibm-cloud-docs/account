# Updating your profile
{: #usersettings}

In your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} profile, you can add a photo and personal information, manage notifications, and monitor your privacy. Setting it up helps your teammates know who you are and how you can help.

Your profile is connected to your log in ID, and it's shared across all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts that you can access. 

## Changing your profile photo
{: #profile-photo}

You can change your profile photo. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, to the **{{site.data.keyword.avatar}}** icon ![Avatar icon](../icons/i-avatar-icon.svg "Avatar") > **Profile**.

  * To add a photo or replace an existing photo, click **Upload**.
  * To remove your photo, click **Delete picture**.

## Editing your information
{: #ibmid}

If you log in with an IBMid, it is the single ID that you use to log in to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account for infrastructure, services, and application features. You can't change your IBMid, but you can edit your associated profile information, such as your name, email, phone number, password, or company name. In the console, go to the **{{site.data.keyword.avatar}}** icon ![Avatar icon](../icons/i-avatar-icon.svg "Avatar") > **Profile**. If you log in with a SoftLayer ID, you can also change your profile information from the Profile page.

If you log in with an ID from an external identity provider, then your information from your identity provider is displayed. However, you can't update it on the Profile page. You must update your user information with your identity provider.

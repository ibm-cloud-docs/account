{: toc-completion-time="20m"}

This tutorial walks you through how to onboard a sample virtual server image for virtual private cloud (VPC) to your account with a software plan. By completing this tutorial, you learn how to create a private catalog, import the image to Partner Center, add a pricing plan, validate that it can be installed on a selected deployment target, and make the virtual server image available to users who have access to your account. As you complete the tutorial, adapt each step to match your organization's goal. This tutorial includes steps for deploying a virtual server image to a target {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). As a result, you incur associated infrastructure charges.
{: shortdesc}

Onboarding Virtual Server Images for VPC with {{site.data.keyword.IBMz}} deployment support is available in private catalogs. The onboarding experience for {{site.data.keyword.IBMz_notm}}-supported Virtual Server Images is the same as how you onboard other Virtual Server Images in your private catalog.
{: note}

## Before you begin
{: #working-catalog-vsivpc-prereqs}

Before you can start onboarding a virtual server image for VPC with a plan, complete the following steps:

1. Verify that you're using a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. See [Viewing your account type](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#view-acct-type) for more details.
1. Virtual server images for VPC must first be imported and validated in your VPC. If your virtual server image is already imported and validated in your VPC, you can skip these steps:
   1. Create your [VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started).
   1. Create an instance of [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage) and upload your image to a bucket.
   1. [Import and validate](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-importing-custom-images-vpc&interface=ui) your custom image in your VPC. Do this for each region in which you want your software to be available and verify that the SHA or checksum matches for the imported image in each region.
1. Make sure you're assigned the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) editor role or higher on the catalog management service and Software Instance. See [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services) for more information.

## Create a private catalog
{: #working-catalog-vsivpc-create}
{: step}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, and click **Create a catalog**.
1. Select **Product default** as the catalog type.
1. Enter the name of your catalog, for example, `Sample virtual server image`.
1. Select **No products** to exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog from your catalog.
1. Click **Create**.

## Add the image to your private catalog
{: #working-catalog-vsivpc-onboard}
{: step}

1. In the Products section, click **Add product**.
1. Select **Software** as the product type.
1. Select **Virtual server image for VPC** as the delivery method.
1. Select the image that you want to onboard.

   If the virtual server image you want to add is not included in the list of available images, click **Import a new image** to import it. Your image must be imported into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC, in an available status, with an x86 or s390x architecture in order for you to onboard it to a private catalog. Also, your image can't be used with a bare metal profile or instance groups, or encrypted. An image can be added to one product only within one private catalog at a time. If the image you want to import is already imported into another product, you must remove the image from that product or delete the product before you add the image to a new product.
   Only images with an x86 architecture support plans.
   {: tip}

1. Enter the software version, for example, `1.0.0`.
1. Select **Developer tools** as the product category.
1. Click **Add product**.

## Import the product to Partner Center
{: #working-import-product-pc}
{: step}

You can easily import the product that your team has created from a private catalog to Partner Center and start defining your product details. To import a product from a private catalog, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center > My products**.
1. From the **My products** page, click **Create**.
1. Select **Import existing product**, and click **Next**.
1. Select the private catalog that contains your product and click **Select catalog**.
1. Select the product that you want to import and click **Import**.

## Submit programmatic name for review
{: #working-progname-review}
{: step}

After you import your product to Partner Center, you must get approval for your product's programmatic name to complete further onboarding tasks, such as creating pricing plans. The programmatic name is different than the product's display name. This is your productâ€™s unique ID that is used within all {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} services and tools.

Your programmatic name can't be updated after you submit it for review.
{: important}

Submit your programmatic name for review by completing the following step:

* From the Product details page, review your programmatic name, and click **Submit programmatic name > Yes**.

## Create a plan
{: #working-create-plan}
{: step}

When you onboard your product to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you must define a pricing model for your software in Partner Center. Currently, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports free, usage-based, and bring your own license (BYOL) plans. For more information, see [Defining your pricing model for software](/docs/sell?topic=sell-sw-pricing). For this tutorial, we create a usage-based plan. By adding a usage-based pricing plan, you are indicating that you offer your product as a paid integrated product, and customers need to pay to use it.

When you add a usage-based pricing plan, you provide your suggested retail pricing information. However, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} reserves the rights to set the final pricing for any product that is offered to customers in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
{: important}

To add a usage-based pricing plan to your software, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **My products**.
1. Select the product that you're onboarding, and click **Pricing**.
1. Click **Add plan > Usage-based**.
1. Provide a name for your pricing plan. This name refers to the plan name that appears in the pricing plan list on your product's catalog page when your customers select a pricing plan.
1. Provide a programmatic name for your pricing plan.
1. Select your software type. Usage metrics available within your plan depend on the type of software that is deployed under the plan.
1. Enter your software version. You must select whether you want to validate only one version or a range of versions, or add a semantic version string to match the versions you want to validate.
1. Provide a description for your pricing plan.
1. Click **Save**.

After you add a pricing plan to your software version in Partner Center, you can manage it in your catalog as well. This means that you can change the state of your plan to publish it, add features to it, deprecate it, or update certain plan details. For more information, see [Managing software plans in catalogs](/docs/account?topic=account-sw-manage-plans).

### Submit tax and EFT forms
{: #working-submit-tax-eft-sw}

For products that you offer on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with a paid, usage-based pricing plan, you receive disbursements based on the usage in accordance with your pricing structure. To receive disbursements, you must complete and submit the EFT form and tax documentation.

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **Payments to me**.
1. Download the relevant EFT form, and complete it.

    One of three types of bank documents is required to be submitted with the form. You can submit a scanned copy of a voided check or a bank letter that is signed and stamped by the bank. If you are outside of the United States, you can alternatively provide an online bank statement. The document that you provide must include the bank name, account number, routing number (or bank key or ABA), and the account holder's name.
    {: important}

1. Download the relevant tax documentation, and complete it.
1. Submit the completed documentation and bank document by email to `apremit@us.ibm.com`. Include `cloud.onboarding@ibm.com` on the email.
1. Select **I confirm that I completed and emailed all of the required documents.**.

### Provide the ECCN
{: #working-sw-eccn}

When you define your pricing model, you must provide the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that applies to your product. The ECCN is required for usage-based pricing plans. If you don't have your ECCN, you can find it on the [Commerce Control List](https://www.bis.gov/regulations/ear/interactive-commerce-control-list){: external}.

You must submit your tax and EFT documents and receive approval before you can provide the ECCN if you're adding a usage-based pricing plan.
{: note}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **My products**.

# Why can't I log in to an account I was recently added to?

{: troubleshoot}

You need to accept an invitation to become an active user in a new {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account.
{: shortdesc}

You can't log in to an account you were recently added to.
{: tsSymptoms}

This problem can commonly occur by one of the following reasons:
{: tsCauses}

* You didn't accept the invitation to join the account.
* The invitation expired. You have 30 days to accept an invitation.
* The inviter canceled your invitation.

Complete the following steps to accept the invitation. If your invitation expired, contact the inviter or the account owner. 
{: tsResolve}

* If you're new to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you receive an email that contains all the information you need. Click the invitation link to join the account.
* As an existing member of {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you can accept the invitation in your notifications, by email, or by using the CLI to onboard to the new account. To accept invitations in the CLI, use the [**`ibmcloud login`**](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login) command.

After you completed all the steps and you still get an error, contact [IBM Cloud Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.

# Managing external identity interactions
{: #cross-acct}

By default, users with an IAM access policy on resources in an account can access those resources from any account, not just the one that owns the resource. A user's API key can be used to generate a token and access resources that the user has access to outside of the account where the API key was created. User API keys contain the identity's permissions across all accounts that they are a member of. You can require users to access resources in your account only when authenticated in your account or accounts that you specify.
{: shortdesc}

You can monitor how limiting access to resources in your account affects users without enforcing it by using report-only mode. This way, you can identify gaps in your access policies and make sure that users have the access they need. For the best experience, turn on report-only mode for at least 30 days before you limit access to resources in your account.

If you want to know which identities in your account access a specific resource, see [Auditing access to resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access-report&interface=ui).

Anticipating the name and number of users who are impacted by limiting identity interactions can be difficult. To turn on report-only mode and observe the potential impact of limiting access to resources in your account, complete the following steps:

1. Set up {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} to view IAM audit events. For more information, see [Viewing activity tracking events for IAM](/docs/account?topic=account-at_events_iam#at-viewing-iam)
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Settings** > **Resources**.
1. Click the **Edit** icon ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit").
1. Select **Report-only**.
1. Add accounts to the allowlist (Optional).
    1. Enter the account IDs for the accounts that you want to allow.
    1. Click **Add**.

    If you want users to generate API keys in only your account, don't add any accounts to the allowlist. An empty allowlist restricts all users from accessing resources in your account if they are using API keys that are created in other accounts.
    {: tip}

1. Click **Save**.
1. Next, view your [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} reports](/docs/account?topic=account-cross-acct#view-cross-acct-report).

After you monitor the results from report-only mode for at least 30 days, update the setting to **Limited**.

## Viewing your reports
{: #view-cross-acct-report}

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} events are generated when the restriction is set to  **Report-only** or **Limited**. In **Report-only** mode, both permitted and requests that would be denied are reported. In **Limited** mode, only denied requests are reported.

To view {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} events, you must configure an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance as the target. For more information, see [Configuring an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance as a target](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-getting-started-target-cloud-logs).
{: tip}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Settings** > **Resources**.
1. Click **Edit > Open {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}**.
1. Click **Explore Logs**  to compose a query.
1. Search the logs for the event action: `iam-access-management.account-settings.eval`

### Identifying potential access disruptions
{: #identify-disruptions}

When you are using the **Report-only** mode, identify the cross-account access that is blocked before switching to the **Limited** mode. To assess whether cross-account access would be blocked, complete the following steps:

1. Select the filter for `responseData.isEnforced:"false" AND responseData.decision:"Deny"`
   
This is the most critical analysis you should perform. This query reveals all cross-account access attempts that would be blocked when enforcement is enabled. These results show which identities are currently accessing resources across account boundaries that would be denied access when you switch to **Limited** mode.

2. For each "deny" result, you must determine if this cross-account flow needs to be preserved or if it should be blocked:
   - If the flow should be preserved: Preferably, contact the user and adjust the work flow to ensure the token used is scoped to the correct account, or if that isn't possible, add the external account to your allowlist. For more information, see [Fixing unwanted external identity interactions](/docs/account?topic=account-cross-acct#fix-external-interactions).
   - If the flow should be blocked: No action needed, as it is automatically blocked when the **Limited** mode is selected.

### Validating allowlist changes
{: #validate-allowlist}

When you decide to preserve specific external identity interaction flows by adding accounts to your allowlist, you can verify that these changes are working as expected by using the following steps:

1. Select the filter for `responseData.isEnforced:"false" AND responseData.decision:"Permit"`
   
   This query shows requests that passed the restriction, including those that were previously denied but are now permitted due to your allowlist changes.

2. Look specifically for permits from accounts you recently added to your allowlist to confirm your changes are working correctly. This validation step is required when you've made allowlist changes and want to ensure that the previously blocked cross-account access is now permitted.

### Monitoring Limited mode
{: #monitor-limited}

When the restriction is set to **Limited**, you can monitor blocked requests:

- Select the filter for `responseData.isEnforced:"true" AND responseData.decision:"Deny"`
  
This query displays requests that passed the restriction, including ones that were previously denied but are now allowed due to changes made to your allowlist.

You can add or remove accounts from the allowlist at any time to meet your security requirements. For a list of the actions that generate an event, see [Activity tracking events for IAM](/docs/account?topic=account-at_events_iam).

## Fixing unwanted external identity interactions
{: #fix-external-interactions}

When you identify unwanted external identity interactions in your reports, you have two suggested approaches to resolve them without disrupting essential workflows:

### Using trusted profiles (recommended)
{: #using-trusted-profiles}

Trusted profiles are the suggested method for enabling legitimate use cases where an entity in one account needs to access resources in a different account. This approach gives you precise control over which identities can  log in to your account and which profiles they can assume.

The External Identity Interactions setting does not prevent you from adding specific users, service IDs, or compute resources in other accounts to a trusted profile. Since those identities are then logged in the context of your account, the External Identity Interactions setting no longer restricts them.

To implement this approach, use the following steps:

1. Create a trusted profile in your account. For more information, see [Creating trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile&interface=ui).
2. Add specific identities from other accounts to this trusted profile.
3. Grant the trusted profile appropriate access to resources in your account.
4. Configure external identities to use this profile for resource access.

This method provides better security and auditability as the external identity is operating within the context of your account.

### Using the allowlist feature
{: #using-allowlist}

The allowlist feature is especially useful in Enterprise account structures or other situations where multiple accounts are owned by the same organization and the users and resources in those accounts need to interact with each other.

To implement this approach:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Settings** > **Resources**
2. Click the **Edit** icon
3. Add the account IDs for the trusted accounts to the allowlist
4. Click **Save**

After adding accounts to your allowlist, you should [validate your allowlist changes](#validate-allowlist) to make sure the previously blocked cross-account access is now allowed.

While the allowList approach is simpler to implement, it provides less granular control than trusted profiles as it allows all users from the specified accounts to access resources in your account (provided they have the appropriate permissions).

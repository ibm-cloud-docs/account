# Why can't I access a different {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} location?

{: troubleshoot}

You're unable to create a new location because your account type doesn't allow it.

You receive an error message when you try to create a new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} location.
{: tsSymptoms}

This error typically occurs because you're using a Lite account, which supports development in one public location only. For more information about Lite account features, see [Lite account](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#liteaccount).
{: tsCauses}

To access more locations, upgrade to a billable account. Go to **Manage** > **Account** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, and select **Account settings**. In the Account upgrade section, select your upgrade option.
{: tsResolve}

To view information about using a different region for a service within the account, refer to [Using service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#use-service-endpoint) for global or regional endpoints for a particular service.

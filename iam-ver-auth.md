### Adding authentication factors
{: #add-auth-factors}

Authentication factors are used to authenticate yourself each time you log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} if an administrator enables MFA in at least one of the accounts you are a member of. These factors can be something that you have, like a U2F security key, or that you receive, like a time-based one time passcode (TOTP), or OTP. Make sure you add backup authentication factors. This way, you can prevent losing access to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in the case that one of them becomes inaccessible.

1. From the Verification methods and authentication factors page, click **Show authentication factors**.

    1. For **Email-based**, enter the email address where you want to receive the OTPs.
       1. Click **Send OTP**.
       1. Enter the OTP that you receive.
1. Click **Complete**.

### Removing authentication factors

# FAQs
{: #accountfaqs}

## How do I create an account?
{: #create-account}

Go to https://console.bluemix.net, and click **Create a free account** to create a Lite account that never expires. 

See [Lite account](/docs/account/index.html#liteaccount) for more details about the features that are included.

## What is Cloud Foundry?
{: #cloud-foundry}

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform as a service (PaaS) option available through {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public for building and deploying applications on the cloud. Cloud Foundry organizations and spaces are used within an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account to organize and work with resources and apps available within specific regions. 

For more information about managing orgs and spaces, see [Adding orgs and spaces](/docs/account/orgs_spaces.html#orgsspacesusers). And, if you’re interested in learning more about how to provide access to resources in a Cloud Foundry space, see [Cloud Foundry access](/docs/iam/cfaccess.html#cfaccess).

## Can I move an org to another account?
{: #move-org-diff-account}

At this time you can't migrate an org to a different account. 

## What can I do if I get an error when creating my account?
{: #account-error}

You can open a support ticket if you encounter an error when you try to create your account.

* To open a support ticket from the Support Center, click **Open a ticket** from the Get help section.
* To open a support ticket from the IBM Cloud console menu bar, click **Support** &gt; **Add ticket**.
* After the support ticket is opened, you will receive an email notification momentarily for the ticket. Follow the instructions in the email for further communication on the issue.

## Which Cloud Foundry regions can I use?
{: #whichregions}

In a Lite account, you can work in only one region. In a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can access all regions.

## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle (renewed each month) or on a one-off usage basis. You can have one instance per Lite plan service. Lite pricing plans are offered in all accounts.

## What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}

Reaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not per instance. New instances created in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the 1st of every month.

## How many resource groups, orgs, or spaces can I create?
{: #resourcelimit}

If you have a billable account, there is not a limit on the number of resource groups, orgs, or spaces that you can create within your account. However, if you have a Lite account, you are limited to one org and one resource group.

## How do I upgrade or change my account type?
{: #changeacct}

* To convert your 30-day trial to a Lite account, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg). After confirming eligibility, the Sales team shares a unique link that you can use to try to convert your account. Successful conversion is not guaranteed as Lite accounts are not entirely compatible with 30-day trials.  
* To upgrade from a Lite to a Pay-As-You-Go account, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing** and click **Add Credit Card**.
* To upgrade from a Lite to a Subscription account, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing** and click **Learn more**.
* To convert your Pay-As-You-Go account to a Subscription account, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).

## If I upgrade my Lite account, can I continue using my existing instances?
{: #nochange}

Yes, you can upgrade to a billable account and continue to use the instances you created with your Lite account.

## How do I update my credit card?
{: #updatepayment}

You can easily update the payment method that's associated with your billable account. In the console, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Modify Payment Method**.

## How do I reset my password? 
{: #reset-password}

Depending on which password you are looking to reset, review the following options: 

* If you have a SoftLayer account ID and password, see [Managing Passwords](/docs/customer-portal/cpmanacctmanpw.html#cp_reset-your-password). 
* To reset your VPN password, see [Update a User's VPN Password](/docs/infrastructure/iaas-vpn/update-password.html#update-a-user-s-vpn-password).

## How do I cancel my account?
{: #cancelaccount}

## How do I delete my account?
{: #deleteaccount}

You must contact IBM Cloud Support to open a support ticket and request that your account be deleted. If you have data that is associated with your old account that you want to save and move to a new account, include this information in your email.

## Why is my account deactivated?
{: #account-deactivated}

Your account is most likely deactivated because an authorized user cancelled it or the account is suspended.  

At the discretion of IBM, users who violate the acceptable usage behaviors of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services can be disabled without notice. Some services can be restored if users correct their usage behaviors after they're notified of the offensive action. Otherwise, accounts can be suspended or terminated.

# FAQs
{: #accountfaqs}

## Which {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions can I use?
{: #whichregions}

In a Lite account, you can work in only one region. In a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can access all regions.

## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle (renewed each month) or on a one-off usage basis. You can have one instance per Lite plan service. Lite pricing plans are offered in all accounts.

## What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}

Reaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not per instance. New instances created in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the 1st of every month.

## How do I upgrade or change my account type?
{: #changeacct}

* To convert your 30-day trial to a Lite account, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg). After confirming eligibility, the Sales team shares a unique link that you can use to try to convert your account. Successful conversion is not guaranteed as Lite accounts are not entirely compatible with 30-day trials.  
* To upgrade from a Lite to a Pay-As-You-Go account, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing** and click **Add Credit Card**.
* To convert your Pay-As-You-Go account to a Subscription account, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).

## How do I link my account if I have multiple accounts?
{: #al_multacct}

If you have multiple SoftLayer accounts, you must link the accounts that have a matching {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform account, and an accompanying IBMid.

If you do not have a matching {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform account, and an accompanying IBMid account, a NEW SoftLayer account can be created to link the accounts.

If you are the account master, see [Working with users](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/iam/iamusermanage.html#iamusermanage) for more information.

## How does account linking impact my SoftLayer Master Account ID? 	
{: #al_howaffslmastacct}

## Is there a limit on the number of resource groups, orgs, or spaces that I can create?

If you have a billable account, there is not a limit on the number of resource groups, orgs, or spaces that you can create within your account. However, if you have a Lite account, you are limited to one org and one resource group.

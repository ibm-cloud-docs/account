# Applying feature codes
{: #codes}

Depending on your account type, you can use feature codes to take advantage of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} extra resources, or to add subscription and support credits.
{: shortdesc}


## Applying feature codes for Lite accounts
{: #feature-code-lite}

If you have a Lite account, you can use a feature code to unlock extra resources or capabilities. You must have an Editor role or higher on all account management services, you can apply a feature code.  

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
2. Click **Apply code**.

The extra resources or capabilities that are provided vary depending on the particular code but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB specified by the code
  * Add one organization with a memory quota that is specified by the code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an extra number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
  * Use premium service plans
  * Add subscription and support credits to Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts


## Applying feature codes for billable accounts
{: #feature-code-billable}

For Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts, feature codes are required to add subscription and support credits. After {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales places an order, an email for each subscription and support line item is sent to the appropriate contact. Feature codes must be applied only by the account owner, and the account owner must apply the subscription feature code to the account before applying the support code.

Applying the feature codes ensures that the credits are added to your account and you don't have additional overage charges.
{: tip}

1. From the console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
2. Click **Apply code**.

  Each code can be redeemed only once before the code's expiration date. Entitlement is added to the account of the IBMid user who applies the codes.

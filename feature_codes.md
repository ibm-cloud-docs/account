Are you looking for details about adding subscription credit to your account? See [Managing subscriptions](/docs/account?topic=account-subscriptions) for more information.
{: tip}

You must have the Editor role or higher for all account management services to apply a feature code. 

If you don't have an account yet, you can add your feature code when you [register](/registration) for a new account by clicking **Register with a code** instead of entering your credit card information. If you do have an account, complete the following steps to apply a feature code to your existing account:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Account**, and select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Apply code**.
1. Enter the feature code, which is typically a random alphanumeric value such as `a1b2c3def456`.
1. Click **Apply**.

{: tip}

You must have the Editor role or higher for all account management services to apply a feature code. The resources or capabilities that are provided vary depending on the particular code but include one or more of the following items in general:

* Increase the memory quota to a number of GB that is specified by the code
* Add one organization with a memory quota that is specified by the code
* Add an unlimited number of organizations
* Upload an additional number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
* Use premium service plans
* Convert a Lite account to a trial account, which provides access to more services but only within a limited trial period

If you don't have an account yet, you can add your feature code when you [register](/registration) for a new account by clicking **Register with a code** instead of entering your credit card information. If you do have an account, complete the following steps to apply a feature code to your existing account:



1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Account**, and select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Apply code**.
1. Enter the feature code, which is typically a random alphanumeric value such as `a1b2c3def456`.
1. Click **Apply**.

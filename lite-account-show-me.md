Meaning, you can build smart, connected apps with the best of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} for free for as long as you like.

After you create your Lite account, hit the ground running by hosting your apps with 256 MB of Cloud Foundry runtime memory and 2 GB with Kubernetes clusters.

Add intelligence to your apps with Watson services. You can even combine Watson with the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} to build cutting edge solutions. You'll also have access to {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}, {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}, {{site.data.keyword.prf_hubshort}}, and more.

How is the Lite account different than pay accounts? This Lite account is quota based, which means your usage of the services is capped to a quota. This way, you don't accidentally run up a bill while you're learning about Watson or developing an app that's not ready for production. When you're approaching the limit or hit the quota, we'll notify you so you can take the appropriate actions.

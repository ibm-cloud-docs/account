## Viewing the status of a dedicated multizone region (MZR)
{: #view-private-mzr}

As a user in an account that has access to a dedicated [MZR](#x9774820){: term}, you are able to view incidents, planned maintenance, security bulletins, and announcements that are related to the resources within that MZR in addition to the public regions on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Status page. Also, on the History page, users in the account can view past status-related items that impact the dedicated MZR.

To view the status of a dedicated MZR, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Notifications** icon ![Notifications icon "Notifications"](../icons/Notification.svg) in the menu bar.
1. Click **View cloud status**.
1. Select from the services that are available within the dedicated MZR to view the status of the MZR in the **Private location status** section. To view planned maintenance, security bulletins and announcements that are related only to your dedicated MZR, use the location filter on the appropriate page.

If an incident occurs that affects the dedicated MZR, you can see the following status on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Status page, which shows you the continent where your private MZR is located, and the status of your private region:

![Example of an active incident](images/status_event.png "Example of the Status page when there is an active incident that affects the dedicated MZR."){: caption="An example of the Status page when there is an active incident that affects the dedicated MZR" caption-side="bottom"}

If no active incident occurs that affects the dedicated MZR, you can see the following status on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Status page:

![Example of no active incident](images/status_no_event.png "Example of the Status page when there is no active incident that affects the dedicated MZR."){: caption="An example of the Status page when there is no incident that affects the dedicated MZR" caption-side="bottom"}

## Checking incident reports
{: #status-incident-report}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [Incident reports page](/status/incident-reports){: external} provides a way for you to review technical details of major outages for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services. These Customer Incident Reports (CIR) provide Root Cause Analysis (RCA), which is a problem-solving process that is used for identifying the root causes of an incident and describing the problem. They are publicly available for all major outages.

You can view and download the incident reports from the service health dashboard about any events that affect {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} availability.

The downloadable reports are in PDF file formats. These reports are available for 5 years starting from the date when the event occurred.
{: note}

The events can be region-specific, global, or they might have an unspecified location.

To view the Incident reports page and check RCAs, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, click the **Notifications** icon ![Notifications icon "Notifications"](../icons/Notification.svg) in the menu bar.
1. Click **View cloud status**.
1. Select **Incident reports**.
1. See the table for the incident reports and click the **Download** icon ![Download icon](../icons/download.svg "Download") to download each report.

## Advanced status search
{: #adv-search}

You can search across all tabs on the [Status page](/status), but did you know that you can build URL search values by using query parameters from outside the console?
{: shortdesc}

The following list includes examples of URL search options:

* Load the page with the Status tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status`
* Load the page with the Planned maintenance tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=maintenance`
* Load the page with the Security bulletin tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=security`
* Load the page with the Announcements tab selected: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=announcement`
* Load the page with a search query entered: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=<selected>&query=<query>`
* Land on the page with filters selected. For example, you can set the geographic location to North America by using the following URL search: `console.cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status&region=na`

* Use unique notification identifiers as a search parameter to go directly to the details for the notification. For example, `query=INC1000001` targets items with the ID: `INC1000001`. In this example, `INC1000001` is the case number for a maintenance notification.

### URL query filters:
{: #url-query}

The following table provides information on URL query filters that you can use to search across all tabs on the status page.

| URL Query Parameter | Description                                                                                                                         | Values                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `?type`             | A filter that applies only to the Status tab. Use the `?type` query to filter the Status tab by incidents or maintenance.           | `=incident`, `=maintenance` |
| `?region`           | Filter the page by geographic location.                                                                                             | `=na`, `=eu`, `=sa`, `=ap`  |
| `?component`        | Filter the page by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} components. For example, you might filter by a service you are interested in. | Applies to most global catalog IDs; for example, `?component=iotf-service` filters the page and display events that affect Internet of Things Platform |
{: caption="URL query filters" caption-side="top"}

You can always use the **Filter by** filters, and then copy or bookmark the URL query that is generated. The filters are displayed in your URL and can help you build future queries.

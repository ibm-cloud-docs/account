# Enabling EU support for your account
{: #eu-supported}

If you're the account owner, you can add another layer of protection to your data in the European Union. Turning on EU support for your account ensures that any support ticket you create is sent to {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} support teams in Europe. An EU supported account is useful if, for example, you use resources to process personal data for European citizens.

Turning on the EU supported setting limits Client Service Delivery that is provided by {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} to team members in the European Union region. However, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} processing activities might be performed by teams that are outside of the EU region. Global teams might be contacted when support tickets aren't resolved by the ACS teams in the EU region. The global teams are always contacted at the instruction of the EU support team and only when there's no impact to the security or privacy of your data.

 If {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} experts that are outside of the EU region need access to this data, an EU support team member reviews the access request. Then, the EU support team member provides necessary access to the requested system for a specific timeframe. When that timeframe is over, access is revoked. Throughout this process, your data is always protected.

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Account**, and select **Account settings**.
2. Scroll to the EU Supported section, and click **On**.
3. Read the information about enabling the setting, and select **I understand and agree to these terms**.
4. Click **On**.

   After you enable the setting at the account level, you can use the EU Supported filter to find products that have EU-supported pricing plans. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, expand the **Compliance** section and select **EU Supported**.

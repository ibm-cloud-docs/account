# Activity tracking events for account management
{: #at_events_am}



{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as account management, generate activity tracking events.
{: shortdesc}

Activity tracking events report on activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use the events to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements.

You can use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}, a platform service, to route auditing events in your account to destinations of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where activity tracking events are sent. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-about).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

## Locations where activity tracking events are sent by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}
{: #atracker-locations}



Account management sends activity tracking events by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} in the regions that are indicated in the following table.

## Events for managing account usage reports
{: #at_events_acc_mgt_account_reporst}

These events are generated when a user looks at usage information in the account.

### Account IAM settings events (Deprecated)
{: #at_events_analyze_1}

This section explains events that are generated when you configure the IAM account settings from the **Access (IAM) > Settings** dashboard.

#### Configuring MFA
{: #at_events_analyze_1_1}

When you set on MFA in your account by configuring the **Account Login** section in the **Access (IAM) > Settings** dashboard, you get 2 events:
* Event with action `billing.account-traits.update` that reports the type of MFA that is configured in the account in the `requestData.mfa` field.
* Event with action `billing.account-mfa.set-on` that indicates that MFA is enabled in the account.

When you set off MFA, you get the following 2 events:
* Event with action `billing.account-traits.update` that reports the type of MFA that is configured in the account in the `requestData.mfa` field.
* Event with action `billing.account-mfa.set-off` that indicates that MFA is disabled in the account.

For example, see the `requestData` field for the event `billing.account-traits.update`:

```json
"action": "billing.account-traits.update",
"message": "Billing service: update account traits",
"requestData": {
    "mfa": "",
    "origin": "BSS"
}
```
{: screen}

#### Configuring user list visibility restriction
{: #at_events_analyze_1_2}

When you modify the *User list visibility restriction* IAM account setting in the **Manage > Access (IAM) > Settings** dashboard, you get 1 event with action `billing.account-traits.update`.

For example, see the `requestData` field for the event `billing.account-traits.update`:

```json
"action": "billing.account-traits.update",
"message": "Billing service: update account traits",
"requestData": {
    "origin": "BSS",
    "team_directory_enabled": false
}
```
{: screen}

{: #at_events_analyze_1_reqdata}

Users are required an ID, password, and a time-based one-time passcode to log in.   \n This field is set to `TOTP4ALL` when the account requires MFA for all users.  \n All users by requiring an ID, password, and a time-based one-time passcode.   \n When this field is empty, MFA is not enabled in the account, and all users log in by using a standard ID and password. |

# Enabling your account for DORA compliance
{: #enabling-dora}

If you're the account owner and your company is a financial entity subject to supervision under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), you can enable the DORA designation for your account. This designation enables {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to provide the essential support for your DORA compliance needs.
{: shortdesc}

DORA is a European Union (EU) regulation that creates a binding, comprehensive information communication technology (ICT) risk management framework for the EU financial sector. DORA establishes technical standards that financial entities and their critical third-party technology service providers must implement in their ICT systems by 17 January 2025.

Enable this setting only if your company is a financial entity as defined by DORA.

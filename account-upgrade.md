# Upgrading your account
{: #upgrading-account}

Lite accounts make it easy to get started with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} and try out services. When you are ready for more, you can upgrade your account to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account to unlock the entire catalog of production-ready services.
{:shortdesc}

You can check your current account type by going to **Manage > Account > Account settings** and looking under _Account Type_.

Not sure which type of account you want to upgrade to? Get detailed information about the benefits of each account type in [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).
{: tip}

To upgrade your account, you must have an editor role or higher on all account management services. Learn more about IAM roles for managing accounts in [Platform management roles](/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#platformroles).

## Upgrading to a Pay-As-You-Go account
{: #upgrade-paygo}

With a Pay-As-You-Go account, you pay for only what you use beyond the free runtime and service allowances. After you upgrade, you can continue to use any instances that you created with your Lite account.

To upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**. Then click **Add Credit Card**, and enter your payment information.

After your payment information is processed, your account is upgraded and you can explore and access the full {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. For any billable services that you use beyond any free allowances, you receive a monthly invoice. If your upgrade included a promotional credit, the credit might take a few hours to appear in your account.

## Upgrading to a Subscription account
{: #upgrade-subscription}

With a Subscription account, you commit to a minimum spending amount each month and receive a subscription discount that is applied to that minimum charge. If your usage exceeds your total subscription amount, you're charged the regular non-discounted rate only on the overage.

Subscriptions that you purchase through the console are limited to $5,000 United States dollars (USD) or the equivalent in your billing currency. If you want to purchase a larger subscription, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).

To upgrade from a Lite account to a Subscription account, complete the following steps.
1. Go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**. Then click **Upgrade**, which takes you to the Subscriptions page.
1. Select your monthly spending commitment and subscription term, and click **Get started**.

   If you're not sure how much your typical usage might cost, you can estimate it by using the [cost estimator](https://{DomainName}/estimator/review){:new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").
   {:tip}
1. Review your subscription details, and then enter your payment information.

   After your payment information is processed, your subscription credit is added to your account.

Your subscription renews automatically. If you want to discontinue your subscription renewal, [contact support](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter).

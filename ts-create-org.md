{: troubleshoot}

You try to create more than one org, and you have a Lite account.

You receive an error message when you try to create a new organization.
{: tsSymptoms}

You're likely seeing this error because you're using a Lite account, which supports development in one organization only. For more information about Lite account features, see [Lite account](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#liteaccount).
{: tsCauses}

To create a new org, upgrade to a billable account. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Payments**.
